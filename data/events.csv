Now, almost 70 years later, the New Black School, a Black graduate student group based at The New School, continues the tradition with Black Lives Matter 101, a public series of five “classes” examining Black social movements in the 21st century.  

Topics include the role of faith in advancing social movements, the relationship of the “new” civil rights movement to nascent social movements, the role of technology and new media in controlling and creating new narratives in justice movements, the global efforts to advance justice for Black people worldwide, and the critical need for more action in the realms of health and environmental justice.  

Each ""class"" features a panel of ""visiting scholars,"" experts, activists and a recommended reading list. In keeping with the New School's academic tradition, participants should come prepared to engage, challenge ideas, and commit to individual action.

"Spring MaP Colloquium: ""More than Fair: How Excessive Sympathy for Him (“Himpathy”) Obscures and Causes Misogyny""","THURSDAY, MARCH 1, 2018 AT 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM","



Abstract: 
According to my ameliorative definition, misogyny is, roughly, the “law enforcement” branch of patriarchy, which serves to police, enforce, or restore patriarchal social order—often by visiting hostility on girls and women for perceived violations of gendered norms and expectations. As well as complementary ideologies (most notably, sexism), there is also the flipside of misogyny which deserves to be considered: the exonerating narratives and excessive sympathy of which comparatively privileged men tend to be the beneficiaries. I call the latter ‘himpathy.’ 

This talk departs from the main example of himpathy I discuss in my recent book, Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny: that of Brock Turner, the convicted sexual assailant and then student at Stanford University. (Turner’s trial became notorious when he received disproportionate and inappropriate sympathy over his female victim from multiple sources, including the judge who found him guilty.) But, as I will argue, this turns out to be only one variety of himpathy among many. Himpathy comprises a family of emotional biases that distort our moral thought and attention in ways that not only serve to obscure, but may even plausibly cause, damaging forms of misogyny—e.g., the hostility girls and women face when they try to testify against or seek justice vis-à-vis an antecedent recipient of himpathy for his misogynistic behavior, sexual violence, and so on. The talk will close by exploring some implications of this claim about moral/social psychology for the future of the #MeToo movement.

"Book Launch: #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond
","THURSDAY, MARCH 1, 2018 AT 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM
","Book Launch: #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond
Please join us for the launch of #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond (Public Seminar Books, 2018), a collection of essays from scholars and activists about the 
""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, VA, in August 2017

#Charlottesville: Before and Beyond, a project of Public Seminar Books, is the first book to emerge from, and critically respond to, the violence that took place in Charlottesville, VA, in August 2017, when white nationalists descended on the city to protest the removal of a Confederate monument in a public park near the University of Virginia. 

The violence that ensued —  four casualties, including the murder of counter-protester Heather Heyer — left the country bewildered, angry, and frightened about ascendant racism.

The essays in #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond attempt to answer questions that still plague us after the violence of August 2017. How much is the current president to blame for the sudden visibility of white supremacist groups? What are we to do with America’s tragic racial history and relics that commemorate the violence of slavery and the Civil War? Where can we turn as political conversation stalls around these important subjects? What lessons can we learn? What are our responsibilities as citizens?

Part one of the book documents and comments upon the immediate aftermath of the violence. The essays in part two, address the context, before and after the outbreak of violence. These essays reflect on the social, political and cultural landscape of the nation, the role of the media, and the logic of “punching Nazis in the face.”

Speak-Ez: Hear The Voices of Experience
We are bombarded with shocking images of extreme weather and its devastating impacts. All life as well as what we build to protect ourselves is being uprooted, shattered. The already vulnerable are hit hardest. And we are being called on to respond to this new world.

How can we answer the call when we have cut ourselves off from fully ‘taking in’ this collective social-injustice and ecological challenge? How can we imagine what it is to have everything torn away from us by the very Elements we thought we had insulated ourselves from: fierce winds, torrential waters, mudslides, earthquakes, and raging, consuming fires.

This is the story of those who will not surrender in the fight to protect people and planet.

After winning the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015, she was assassinated on March 2, 2016. 

The film features the work of COPINH -- a grassroots Lenca indigenous organization co-founded by Berta Cáceres and OFRANEH -- a grassroots Garífuna organization led by Miriam Miranda. These visionary sister organizations are leading the struggle in Honduras to defend land, food sovereignty, and indigenous rights from corporate greed and corrupt governments.

","THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2018 AT 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM
","Expanded Sanctuary is part of a series of events that explore the possibilities of sanctuary – as ideal, as theory, as practice, as historical proposition, as a vision of social justice for the present.

Expanded Sanctuary will focus on the intersections between sanctuary and diverse social movements working against racism, hetero/sexism, violence and containment. What are the connections between immigration detention, deportation, dispossession, gender-based violence, homophobic/transphobic violence and the carceral state? Does sanctuary offer a vision of politics that can encompass diverse struggles and provide a basis for cross-movement coalitions? How can spaces of solidarity with undocumented people also address the broader challenges of inequality in American cities which include police violence and mass incarceration? These questions are already being probed by activists on the ground. This event is an occasion to reflect, imagine and strategize in a dialogue between scholars and activists.
The discussion will continue with Transnational Sanctuary, a follow-up event on April 12.","Starr Foundation Hall, Room UL102, University Center

Work as Emancipation or Emancipation from Work?,"WEDNESDAY, MARCH 14, 2018 AT 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM
","Work as Emancipation or Emancipation from Work?
The Studley Graduate Program in International Affairs presents a panel on feminist economics. 


Women’s economic empowerment has now become a buzzword both in international institutions and policymaking, with the SDGs making it a priority. Economists and policymakers have generally considered greater labor force participation as the primary channel through which such empowerment can be achieved. But is more work necessarily the answer? Considering that poor women from the South have always worked excessively long hours, that the nature of work itself is often degrading, exploitative and poorly paid, and that most women work a double day, is this emphasis on work as empowerment misplaced? Given the rapid rise of robotic and AI technologies that threaten future job creation particularly in exports, can we imagine alternative paths to economic empowerment that recognize women's 'invisible' labor? What role do a Universal Basic Income and other social protection schemes play in this regard? Is it possible to reimagine work as an aesthetic and creative category rather than simply a category of capitalist production? How can feminist economics contribute to this discussion? This panel will reflect on women and work from different perspectives and debate this issue through brief presentations and interaction.

These Principles were created to build a national and international movement to fight the destruction and seizing of lands and communities and to secure political, economic, and cultural liberation denied for over 500 years of colonization and oppression. Since then, The Principles have served as a defining document for the grassroots movement for environmental justice.","at Tishman Auditorium, 63 Fifth Avenu",,"Maya Wiley
