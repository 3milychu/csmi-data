The Tishman Center addresses the increasingly urgent need to integrate design and environment to confront climate change and its social impacts.

The Tishman Center is committed to fostering an environmental philosophy and an understanding of sustainability that digs deeper than simply championing the concepts of being ""green"" or ""eco-friendly."" At the Tishman Center and The New School, sustainability is truly cross-disciplinary, incorporating and collaborative space that brings together stakeholders from a variety of disciplines, schools, and populations. It will be a communication bridge between the university's operational sustainability efforts and the university community. We serve as a collaborative resource center and academic convener for environmental justice groups, community leaders, design, and climate experts to create discourse, dialogue, and action on today's most challenging issues.","Tishman Environment and Design Center

The New School will disrupt regular curriculum across the University in order to learn about climate change and its implications, particularly the unequal and devastating impacts on the most vulnerable and least responsible communities around the globe. This disruption is an opportunity to come together to take concrete action toward fighting climate change and supporting climate justice.

By interrupting “business as usual” across the University, and engaging in a series of service, learning, and action opportunities, we will:
Make visible the climate crisis
Highlight the unequal impacts on vulnerable communities
Reflect on and deepen understanding of the importance of just and equitable solutions
Build coalitions and partnerships

Sustainability Learning Outcomes
Working closely with the leadership and faculty at all five schools at the New School, the Tishman Center is embarking on a multi-year project to incorporate sustainability learning outcomes that account for the social, political, and economic dimensions of environmental issues into the academic experience of all New School students. 

In collaboration with our Affiliated Faculty, the Tishman Center is exploring strategies to uplift existing sustainability-related course offerings, design new methods of engaging students in sustainability learning, and partner with community organizations to provide real-world learning experiences for students. We are developing and delivering opportunities for all students to learn about sustainability in ways that fit and complement their majors and disciplines from jazz to design, liberal arts to social research, and beyond.

Center for New York City Affairs,Urban and Community Development,"Transforming Policy in NYC
The Center for New York City Affairs at The New School is an applied policy research institute that drives innovation in social policy. The Center provides analysis and solutions. We focus on how public policy impacts low-income communities, and we strive for a more just and equitable city.

Research 
The Center’s in-depth, original, and timely studies illuminate injustices and propose workable solutions. Our investigative reports have helped shape good public policy in, for example, reducing the alarming rate of chronic absenteeism in many New York City schools, and in addressing the rising tide of children growing up in homeless shelters. We continue to break new ground in areas ranging from analyzing the persistence of racial and income segregation in public schools to chronicling the progress of juvenile justice reform. Policymakers, journalists, and others rely on the Center’s credible and well-informed work – work that not only makes headlines, but also makes a difference.

Ideas 
We identify practical solutions and fresh ideas to address pressing social and economic issues. Urban Matters is our newest, weekly outlet for ideas and insights from leading thinkers and practitioners. Read our latest posts on issues ranging from juvenile justice reform to Hurricane Sandy’s continuing impact to the racial wealth divide at centernyc.org/urbanmatters.

Action
We engage communities and policymakers and are committed to the debate of vital political and social issues. Through public events and our written work we provide opportunities for dialog. These conversations put leaders on the record, forge connections among groups, and inform ongoing policy change. We provide ‘news you can use’ — including detailed information on each and every public school in the city.","72 Fifth Avenue, 6th Floor

Justice 
In recent years, we have provided vital analysis to support effective public investment in mental health services for incarcerated teens, the launch of the Close to Home initiative, efforts to raise the age for prosecution as an adult, and broad public engagement on issues of incarceration and racial injustice. In the coming year, we will assess developments in policing, efforts to reform City jails, and a broad array of new programs for justice-involved youth and individuals with mental illnesses. 

Poverty 
The Center focuses on low wages, housing and homelessness, health and mental health concerns, and family violence. For decades, the Center has been a leading voice for improvements in the child welfare and Family Court systems. Building on research on brain development and toxic stress, our recent work addresses the needs of young children and includes an examination of new mental health programs for babies and toddlers, efforts to improve the quality of publicly subsidized child care, and services for young families in homeless shelters. 

Education
Our approach to education combines practical information for parents and cutting-edge policy research. Our Insideschools website provides definitive information to more than 1.8 million parents and educators each year. Recent research projects include a look at opportunities to support integrated schools in changing communities, an in-depth study of chronic absenteeism, a toolkit on implementing community schools, and several reports on gaps in math and science instruction. 

Immigrants & Global Cities 
Feet in 2 Worlds (Fi2W) works with immigrant journalists to produce news stories that express perspectives rarely featured in the mainstream press. Our reports highlight social issues, human interest stories, arts and culture, and politics. Fi2W has trained more than 100 immigrant and ethnic media journalists who work at media outlets including The New York Times, the Associated Press, public radio, and others. Current projects include examining climate change and immigrant communities, the role of Latino voters in the upcoming presidential election, and the role of food in culture and immigrant employment. 

Politics & Elections 
We have a long tradition of covering the day's most important political events at the city, state, and national level. This year, join our Politics and Policy Series, a thought-provoking and stimulating series of events featuring the hands-on experience and intellects of both American and global politics experts in order to dissect the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.

Designed Realities Lab,"Art, Design, and Theory","The Designed Realities Lab is a research and teaching platform working across The New School that combines design with social thought and the liberal arts in order to develop alternative narratives to technological futures.
The lab is dedicated to sustaining the idea of multiple possibilities and alternative values in the face of an increasingly monolithic worldview of our technological future. It uses design as a catalyst for a form of interdisciplinary imagining that synthesizes social and political thought, world-making, and emerging technology. At its core is the idea that imagination can be a political force within society.

The main focus is on understanding, challenging and offering new examples of how technological narratives can be developed and presented through design and critical thinking in ways that challenge assumptions and inspire further imagining rather than communicating a vision of how things will or should be. It aims to contribute to a public environment where new visions can flourish, imagination thrives, and alternative technological narratives can begin to emerge more organically, bottom-up rather than top-down.

The unit operates on a number of levels: collaborative research projects, commissions, self-initiated projects, and taught studio classes, all disseminated through talks, exhibitions and publications.","Designed Realities Lab Anthony Dunne, Co-Director Fiona Raby, Co-Director Office Address 2 West 13th Street Room L1012A New York, NY 10011",Parsons School of Design ,"ANTHONY DUNNE - Professor of Design and Emerging Technology and a Fellow at the Graduate Institute for Design, Ethnography & Social Thought (GIDEST)

","EML offers opportunities for field work on participatory media / human rights and media.  For four years now we have been partnered with the Arab American Family Support Center in Brooklyn, an after school learning center where we’ve been running youth media workshops.  Fieldwork also includes the International Field study abroad programs.  

EML is a lab for student workshops.  The workshops have ranged from production and post production workshops, grant writing for documentary films, media packaging and audience engagement workshops.  

EML offers screenings and sponsored talks and conferences.  Over the past few years, EML has sponsored several media events here at the New School such as the Youth Media Summit and the participatory media event with the online platform, Beirut Syndrome.

EML is a space for faculty mentoring of students in classes related to social media, participatory media, documentary production, post production, and our classes related to media and human rights.

The Healthy Affordable Materials Project seeks to improve the lives and health of affordable housing residents by reducing the use of toxic materials in building products. Through the use of healthier building products and furnishings, the built environment contributes to the improved health of all people, especially lowest income communities.  

The HAMP collaborative goal is to increase the adoption of healthier building protocols and practices within the affordable housing sector, leading to measurable increase in building product specifications that reflect healthier choices. 

This change will result in reduced exposure throughout the system by decreasing or eliminating known harmful chemicals from building products and furnishings widely used in affordable housing.

Our Goals
In the broadest sense, our goals are for healthier spaces and healthier lives. To achieve this, we strive to:

1. Improve today’s commonly used materials to reduce exposure to toxics and improve health.
2. Foster knowledge and awareness of today’s healthier material alternatives—make them more marketable, accessible, and popular.
3. Invent, test, and implement tomorrow’s healthy materials.
4. Work with manufacturers to promote transparency and drive innovation.
5. Create healthier homes for people living in poverty.",supported in part by a grant from The JPB Foundation.,"American Sustainable Business Council

Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies at the New School for Social Research brings together students and faculty from across The New School for interdisciplinary conversations around theoretical approaches to and analytic methods for the study of capitalisms. Affiliated faculty and students work in diverse and innovative fields including the history of capitalism, economic sociology, international political economy, heterodox economics, critical theory, economic anthropology, and science and technology studies.

The Robert L. Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies seek to develop a common language with which capitalism can be understood, analyzed, interpreted, and engaged — with rigor, with precision, and in a manner that is accessible to the broadest possible audience. Our graduate and undergraduate courses examine the basic logic of capitalism (as conceived by a range of theorists), its various historically contingent forms, and its ability to structure our political possibilities and creative endeavors. Our program supports diverse inquiries into the major structuring force in contemporary society, posing questions both timeless and pressing.

Institute for Critical Social Inquiry,Social Research and Design,"The Institute is designed to provide scholars with the opportunity to spend a week at the New School’s campus in Greenwich Village, working closely with some of the most distinguished thinkers shaping the course of contemporary social inquiry. The Institute is founded on the premise that responding to current and emergent problems requires developing our collective capacities to formulate new and better questions, rather than relying on the application of all too familiar ready-made theories. In the current landscape in which most of us work today, there is seldom the time or the opportunity for in-depth exploration of those modes of inquiry most relevant to our research agendas and developing projects. How often have we all wished we could steal the time from our current writing and teaching obligations to return to a thinker whose style of thinking and whose conceptual insights shaped us at earlier moments and would mean as much or more to know better today? Our themes are mobile and responsive, joining conceptual labor with pressing political concerns in our times, in an effort to understand and act upon better that which is emergent on our collective horizons.","6 E 16TH ST, 9TH FL.

New School Social Innovation Initiative,,"a program incubator for diverse activities that advance, broaden, and deepen social innovation–related education at the university.

The New School has long been a center for social innovation. Social innovation as a field of theory and practice is designed to enhance the capacity of individuals, communities, and organizations to devise effective, just, and sustainable solutions to social and environmental problems.

Examples of social innovation are all around us. Microfinance ventures, hospices, fair trade organizations, passive houses, and rooftop gardens are just a few of the social innovations developed by nonprofits, public institutions, and businesses.

The Social Innovation Initiative was established in 2011 with support from the Provost's Office and the deans of the New School for Public Engagement, Parsons The New School for Design, and Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts. The Social Innovation Initiative offers opportunities for students and faculty from different colleges of The New School to participate in interdisciplinary learning, research, and practice that contributes to real-world problem solving. Through courses, workshops, conferences, and an innovation competition, we equip students to address contemporary environmental and social challenges in innovative ways, whatever their career paths may be.

Our partnerships with global organizations such as Ashoka U and Dell Social Innovation Challenge as well as with many local and national community, cultural, and civic partners strengthen our work and offer our students numerous opportunities beyond the walls of The New School.

The New School’s unique approach to social innovation education relies on collaboration between several schools:

Ashoka U Changemaker Campus Initiative
In 2009, The New School was selected to participate in the Ashoka U Changemaker Campus Initiative, a national consortium of universities. The Changemaker Campus Initiative aims to expand social entrepreneurship education across campuses and explore ways universities can become hubs for social innovation to develop solutions to diverse social and environmental challenges.

Dell Social Innovation Competition
Building the next generation of social entrepreneurs depends not just on world-class teaching and training, but also on supporting students with opportunities for strategic partnerships and start-up capital. With the goal of bringing visibility and public recognition to thousands of social entrepreneurs worldwide, The New School is partnering with Dell to participate in the annual Dell Social Innovation Competition, an international student competition that awards a $50,000 grand prize for the best idea.

DESIS Lab members explore the relationship between design and social change. Our goal is to advance the practice and discourse of design-led social innovation to foster more equitable and sustainable cities and practices. In a complex world facing numerous systemic challenges, DESIS Lab members rethink assumptions about cultural and economic environments, bringing nuanced approaches drawn from integrated design practices to communities of all kinds. In the DESIS Lab, service design is considered an advanced approach, one integrating many design disciplines.

Foundations
Three foundations guide our research in design strategies:

Bridging structural holes: Social settings often suffer from severe information asymmetries. We seek to bridge information gaps and find ways of sharing needed information more effectively.
Valuing tacit knowledge: People in a social system rely on both explicit forms of knowledge and “tacit knowledge”—information individuals and communities develop and share through habits and customs. The use of participatory design methods reveals and codifies this subjective knowledge.
Nurturing heterarchies: Whereas researchers have focused on social hierarchies and structural asymmetries, little attention has been paid to heterarchies—the lateral forms of collaboration through which social life is constructed. We promote such interdependent networks as it generates more opportunities for heterogeneous forms of collaboration.
Local and Global
The lab works with local partners in New York City and with global partners through the DESIS Network, participating in large-scale research programs and projects to effect social change. The DESIS Network consists of more than 30 design labs based in universities around the world that orient their teaching and research activities towards social innovation and sustainability. DESIS processes and initiatives involve the following:

Collecting social innovation practices and generating greater visibility for them
Promoting collaborative projects and organizing academic events to explore these practices
Developing teaching tools and co-producing courses internationally to showcase these practices and their contextual variations
Carrying out comparative research programs to track these practices and their outcomes  AMPLIFYING CREATIVE COMMUNITIES IN NEW YORK CITY
Launched in 2009 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this initiative investigates ways design can be used to amplify community-led approaches to sustainable living in New York City.

Visit the Amplifying Creative Communities website for more information.

PUBLIC & COLLABORATIVE
Launched in 2011 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this multi-project initiative investigates the role design can play in building bridges between government and people, allowing for socially innovative methods of providing services for the public good.

Transregional Center for Democratic Studies (TCDS),International Affairs and Global Perspectives,"The Transregional Center for Democratic Studies (TCDS) builds on international and interdisciplinary traditions that The New School for Social Research (NSSR) inherited from the University in Exile, which was established at The New School in 1933. TCDS was founded in 1990, inspired by the peaceful dismantling of communism in Eastern Europe, and has been directed from the start by Elzbieta Matynia, associate professor of Sociology at The New School for Social Research. The center offers unique opportunities for global advanced research and cross-cultural collaboration. Its projects address democratic transitions, the workings of collective memory, and—increasingly important in times of massive migrations—the development of a ""culture of borderlands"" and an ""ethos of border thinking"" in order to promote a general openness to difference, hybridity, and diversity in civil society and civic life.

New York, NY 10011",The New School for Social Research,ELZBIETA MATYNIA - Professor of Sociology and Liberal Studies at The New School for Social Research ,#NAME?,#NAME?,"TCDS's integrated program activities draws on the concept of the ""region"" as a promising perspective from which to examine the complex relations between the local and the global, not only for policy makers, but also for nongovernmental organizations and a new breed of practice-oriented scholars in the social sciences and humanities. While yielding more comprehensive, in-depth explanations of processes taking place in today's world, the transregional approach encourages and facilitates the quest for consensus among peoples separated by divergent histories, cultures, and economies.

An core belief at TCDS is that adequate social and human capital is an essential element in forming and consolidating democratic governance. One proven cost-effective and valid method of cultivating this capital is to invest in the academic and professional development of, and collaboration with, civic-minded graduate students and junior faculty members at universities here and abroad. TCDS's programs, always open to the broad interests of our students and faculty and inspired by world events, have been engaged primarily with five regions: Central and Eastern Europe; Central Asia and the Caucasus; Sub-Saharan Africa; Latin America; and North America.

TCDS's initiatives have led to the emergence and cultivation of extensive scholarly networks in these regions, bringing young scholars and civically committed academics together with the graduate students of the NSSR. There are many ways to get involved with TCDS, including applying to our Democracy &amp; Diversity graduate summer institutes (held annually in July in Wroclaw, Poland and January in Johannesburg, South Africa) for the opportunity to study directly with colleagues from those regions; attending our lectures, events and conferences at the New School; and by becoming a TCDS Associate.",,,"Telephone: 212.229.5580 x3136

","The Urban Sytems Lab is an interdisciplinary research, design and practice space at The New School focused on improving life in cities where most of us live. Our interdisciplinary scholarship examines the social, ecological, and technical-infrastructure system (SETs) interactions that drive persisent patterns and challenges in cities.  Our goal is that by studying and visualizing SETs dynamics we hope to provide new insight into opportunities for supporting wellbeing of human and non-human species for planning and designing more equitable, resilient and sustainable cities. Rapidly expanding urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change pose potentially dramatic implications for the wellbeing of urban residents and the natural systems they depend on. Our research, from theory to practice, aims to reveal and support the social-ecological-technical system processes that together drive everyday experiences in cities and urban areas. We use both empirical (e.g. “Big Data” analysis, field experiments, spatial methods, scenario modeling) and theoretical approaches (social-ecological systems and resilience theory) as well as cutting-edge data visualization to advance urban systems research and practice. 
Our research spans a variety of urban ecological research areas, including:
Urban resilience
Social-ecological-technical systems
Urban land use planning
Urban futures and scenarios
Urban biodiversity and ecosystem services
Urban ecosystem structure and functioning
Social equity and access to urban green space
Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change in cities",,,"timon.mcphearson@newschool.edu
