Breaking Barriers: Social Ventures and Food Access,"In this course, students will have the opportunity to develop social entrepreneurial ventures to give low-income communities access to affordable, locally grown food. To successfully bring about the intended outcomes, solutions proposed by students need to be properly designed, scalable, and show the potential of being replicable. Based on insights taken from the positive and negative outcomes of Corbin Hill Road Farm (www.corbinhillfarm.com) and other initiatives to address the needs of low-income communities, this course challenges students to formulate social ventures that address one of the following aspects affecting access to affordable fresh produce in low-income communities: transportation costs, community organizing, scalability, creation of a cold chain, and access to financing.",DENNIS DERRYCK,,,,"The Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at The New School for Public Engagement.",Social Innovation and Design ,Courses,1,0,0,0,1

New Media: Global Equalizer,"New information and communication technologies are transforming the most remote and disenfranchised communities in the world’s poorest countries. This course examines the use of new communication technologies in developing countries. How do these tools enable ordinary people in developing countries to give voice to their own stories? Can new media equalize participation and access to information for people heretofore bypassed by the benefits of globalization? Mobile phones, Internet kiosks, and satellite uplinks are being adopted and adapted by resourceful and creative users throughout the developing world. Through analytic studies, samples of new media, and direct engagement with some of the users themselves, the class explores how this connectivity, both technological and human, is transforming life in developing countries. From eyewitness reporting in societies as closed as Myanmar to community action in countries undergoing political upheaval such as Kenya to public health activities in Indonesia to joint problem solving by farmers, scientists, and policymakers half a world apart, new channels of communication and cross-cultural awareness are opening up within and beyond borders.",INSTRUCTOR: MELANIE BETH OLIVIERO,,,,"The Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at The New School for Public Engagement.",Social Innovation and Design ,Courses,1,1,0,1,1
"NGOs and International Development
","This course studies a specific set of actors and practices in international development, the ways in which non-governmental organizations (NGOs) seek development impact, and the contemporary economic and political context of such NGO practice. Specifically, the course focuses on these core questions: What is development? Why should we care for it? What are NGOs?

"Power, Strategy, and Social Change","This course prepares students to think strategically about advocacy methods, leverage points, and resources for change. Students focus on the nature of power in its various forms (electoral power, issue framing, financial, citizen mobilization, public opinion) and explore how power and resources can be acquired, evaluated, mobilized, and deployed in the service of promoting a policy agenda. Students develop an understanding of the leverage points for achieving social change, using case studies to become familiar with legislative processes, the budget cycle, the electoral arena, the regulatory system, public interest law, labor relations, procurement, and the various paths to influencing public opinion and decision makers. By the end of the course students develop a sophisticated and comprehensive strategy for conducting a campaign for issue advocacy or political change.

Slums and Urban Development","The course reviews the literature and processes involved with slum formation and their persistence in cities in developing countries. It makes use of studies, guest lecturers, and film to gain an understanding of the dimension and circumstances that characterize these locations in cities across the globe and the policies and factors that both contribute to their existence and improve their circumstances. Particular attention will be paid to the efforts of community based organizations and their associated networks in dealing with the host of problems posed by living in slums. Emphasis will also be given to the underlying economics of slums and the policies and the collective actions which are taken by those living there. It will be run in a seminar format with students preparing papers and discussing both case studies, and historical and theoretical analyses of slums.

"Sustainable Development
INSTRUCTOR: TBD

","This course will examine these differing views of sustainable development both in theory and through the examination of specific development projects. Economists approach environmental questions through three differing theoretical schools: environmental economics, ecological economics, and political economics. These schools use differing techniques to value the environment, offer different understandings of what would be good environmental and economic outcomes, and advocate different policies to achieve sustainability. Underlying these differences are political economic questions of distribution of power and resources both within specific countries and globally. This course will explore the range of views, with an emphasis on understanding the assumptions underlying their disagreements, and on the policy implications of these views. Topics will include the ""green development"" policies of the World Bank, the controversial issue of water privatization, carbon trading as a response to global warming, the effects of neo-liberal policies on the environment, and cases of specific commodities such as gold and cotton which illuminate the problems and complexities of sustainable development.

"Urban Water: Access, Privatization, & Environment","This course will examine the different challenges faced by cities from both developing and developed countries in providing safe and reliable access to water and sanitation services, in a context of increasing demand and shrinking available resources. The combination of urban population growth, lack of infrastructure, scarcity of natural resources, impact of climate change on resources and sea rise level, and increasing competition in usage from agriculture and alternative energy production contribute to transform existing issues into one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century. Situations are different in northern and southern cities but studying both cases will increase the global understanding of political, social, economical, technical and environmental aspects, and widen the range of the possible solutions to be implemented. In all, governance pays a key role. What is the current state of implementation of the Millennium Development Goals with respect to access to water and sanitation services? What is at stake in the privatization debate? What can we expect from technical innovations (desalination, water reuse, conservation...)? This course will provide an understanding of global water challenges, a basic knowledge of technical and economical aspects of systems of development and operation, a comprehension of water policies implemented at both local and international levels, and present through a series of case studies a range of experiences and solutions. A visit of water treatment installations in the NY metropolitan area will be organized.

Beyond iCelebrities: Social Networking and Social Activism,"Popular social networking sites have evolved exponentially in the past few years, alongside Internet- savvy grassroots organizations like MoveOn.org. The course outlines the recent history of MoveOn.org, Code Pink, Facebook, YouTube, and Second Life (virtual activism) and the viral nature of Internet trends. What happens when corporate entities enter social networks on the Internet? What is the link between viral marketing and social change? Questions about the nature of the “collective generosity” mindset inherent in millennial offerings like Wikipedia are examined, with an eye to mapping global resource and information networks to include the most disenfranchised of global citizens.

Corporate Philanthropy and Social Responsibility,"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a critical topic in the debate about the future, as citizens, governments, advocacy organizations, and corporations themselves grapple with the role of companies in relation to a wide range of concerns, including environmental sustainability and global climate change; globalization and outsourcing; labor practices and policies; consumer preferences; social entrepreneurship; work-life balance; the international geopolitical influence of corporations; and the opportunity for businesses to “change the world” into a better place through their resources. This course offers students an opportunity to understand the spectrum of varied corporate stances on the issue of social responsibility, the evolution of the concept of CSR, international variation in CSR philosophy, and current research on the influence and possible future directions of CSR. Students explore and understand theories of Corporate Social Responsibility, analyze motivations for and effectiveness of CSR using those theory frameworks, and review perspectives on the relationship of CSR to current social and economic issues.",INSTRUCTORS: JOHN CLINTON,,,Graduate,"Offered by The Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at The New School for Public Engagement.",,Courses,1,0,0,1,0
Creative DIY Cultures and Participatory Learning,"This seminar explores creative DIY (do-it-yourself) cultures of hacking, tinkering, and inventive practices from crafts and electronics to digital media production, networked design collaboration, and participatory learning. We examine the pedagogical ideas of critical literacy by Paulo Freire and Augusto Boal; child-centered experiential learning by Jean Piaget; psychology of play and imagination by Vygotsky; constructionist learning by Seymour Papert; and participatory cultures by Henry Jenkins. Students will then explore diverse DIY practices as forms of cultural, political or subversive expression, including amateur/pirate radio, punk and rave subcultures, mash-ups, as well as DIY design and open source programming. We consider the nature of emerging networked DIY communities and maker/hacker spaces, and their role in creating new forms of cultural production, participatory learning, and civic agency.

Fashion and Social Innovation,"This seminar interrogates the category of fashion through various cross-cultural examples of ""innovation"" in dress, body ornamentation, and clothesmaking by asking what are the cultural assumptions underlining popular beliefs about social innovation in fashion. In exploring this question, the course combines readings on the embodiment of aesthetic and material practices with cross-cultural studies that examine a range of institutional sites where bodies are fragmented, commodified, and fashioned. Central to this effort are questions about power, ideology, and moral quandaries arising from both the production and consumption of wearable forms.","

"Gender, Development & Finance
","This course focuses on the financial experiences of low-income people, especially women, in the US and internationally. The first segment of the course lays a foundation for why it is important to look at poverty, economic development, and financial literacy through a gendered lens. We will also familiarize ourselves with the asset building literature and discuss how this way of thinking about individuals' financial well-being constitutes a departure from traditional urban poverty frameworks, which tend to focus on income. We will spend some time understanding the extent to which traditional financial institutions (such as banks) and strategies serve (or do not serve) this group. We will look at relevant recent trends, such as the rise of fringe financial services that include check cashers and payday lenders. We will also examine alternative financial strategies, such as microenterprise development and individual development accounts (IDAs) that serve low-income people differently, and study best practices from the US and abroad. Throughout the course, we will discuss policy interventions that could create a better environment for asset building and ownership. The course requires no prerequisite knowledge of economics or finance.",INSTRUCTOR: TBD,,,,"

Inclusive and Development Finance,"Governments and civil society organizations have often stepped in where private finance has feared to go. Governments have set up institutions (e.g., development banks, postal savings banks), as have community institutions (e.g., savings and credit cooperatives, microfinance institutions) to provide financing for priority sectors (e.g., agriculture) or populations (e.g., poor people, women). Governments have also made policies to encourage or force private financial institutions to provide the specific services to priority sectors or populations. Nevertheless, unserved and underserved populations continue to rely heavily on informal mechanisms for at least some financial services (moneylenders, rotating savings and credit associations). This course will examine public and civil society efforts to sustainably and effectively expand access to financial services for social and developmental priority purposes. It will look at issues of demand and supply, and at actual and desirable policies. It will ask students to debate controversial issues, of which there are many in this field and few with easy answers.

","Sustainability has been elevated to a key driver for business today. A number of organizations, large and small, are now creating and implementing strategies that address critical environmental and social issues while delivering value to a range of stakeholders. The main objectives of this course are twofold. First, we explore the contextual framework for sustainability leadership in terms of policy, environmental and social trends, stakeholder expectations, and competitiveness. Second, we explore the practical tools, technologies, tactics, and communication necessary to lead a robust strategy for sustainability. Through case studies, analysis, discussion, and presentations by practitioners, we examine the complicated factors that leaders (both individuals and teams) must consider.

Race in the U.S.,"The 2016 U.S. Presidential election revealed the stubborn persistence of bigotry in the United States, and demonstrated that race continues to play a significant, if changing, role in how we define our communities, develop our public policy, and shape our democratic institutions. This course brings together scholars, experts, thought leaders and activists to examine such issues as racial stratification, implicit bias, and the complex, intersectional relationships between race, gender, and class. What is race and how do we understand it today? How are demographic shifts driving wedges between communities and/or fostering pluralism? How democratic is our pluralist society? What is the role of racial divides in fomenting political partisanship? What impact does racialized discourse have on such issues as the social safety net, immigration, criminal justice, technology, voting, and urban policy? “Race in the USA” is The New School’s second University course on post-election America, and is sponsored by the Provost’s Office and the 2017 Henry Cohen Lecture Series of The Milano School of International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy.

"BEYOND THE SHARING ECONOMY: PRECARITY, RESISTANCE, AND CAPITALISM","While the most successful companies tout the ""sharing economy"" as flexible, efficient and empowering, in fact, commodification, automation, and financialization are on the increase with drastic consequences in terms of inequality and exploitation. This course explores these increasingly prevalent features of global capitalism today to understand how so much wealth is generated at the top while the economic fortunes and futures of everyone else are rendered frustratingly precarious. Attempting to cut through the rhetoric, the course will investigate the ""sharing"" economy to understand how smart-phones and apps are enabling the commodification of private property and the untethering of workers from traditional forms of job security, made possible by Big Data and algorithmic management. We will explore how global supply-chains make the availability and movement of commodities greater than ever, significantly impacting the power of global labor for resistance. Through the housing crisis, the course shows how financialization, debt and the dispossession of wealth from non-white bodies condition the existence of a permanent underclass of cheap labor. Other case studies will include social media as a site of data accumulation, biotech's commodification of life, and social impact bonds that financialize the population's social welfare along racialized lines. We will conclude by examining the creative forms of resistance advanced by leading scholars, activists, and artists who are refusing the exhaustion and depression of these new economic realities.","FIORI, NICHOLAS",SPRING 2018,"Tues.

After a foundational review of climate science, the concepts of risk and uncertainty, the precautionary principle, and multidisciplinary analyses of sources of climate change denial, students explore how concepts of sustainable cities and urban resilience inform policy at the municipal level, issues associated with complex systems, and the influence of and prospects for citizen engagement with climate impacts. Student teams study cases of community initiatives and city-level policy applications and apply analytical frameworks to selected urban settings/systems. Ethical issues surrounding differential contributions to climate change, and impacts of climate change, are examined. Additionally, the course provides students the opportunity to participate in research and community engagement connected to the Leveraging ""We Are Still In"" initiative, an emerging national network of interdisciplinary higher education/community partnerships addressing climate change launched in Fall 2017.

COMMUNITIES IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT,"As the world is urbanizing, urban poverty and inequality remain two of the biggest and most difficult to address issues. In the midst of a challenging urbanization process, urban poor communities have transformed into central actors in the efforts to address the living conditions of the urban poor. An entirely new range of social movements, networks, and organizations has surfaced across the globe and within cities of the global South. The important rise of transnational advocacy coalitions coincided with a significant paradigm shift in urban governance. Ideologies of urban entrepreneurialism have led to critical shifts not only in terms of how cities are managed but also on how policy decisions are made. However, within this discussion there has been little consideration of the role of slum dweller organizations and their coalition networks in the co-production of urban entrepreneurialism. The course examines how transnational coalitions of the urban poor and their national and city-based social movements contribute in the formulation and co-production of urban policy. In what ways do communities of the urban poor contribute in the process of urban development? What are their most important contributions? What are the challenges that organized urban poor communities face? The objective of the course is two-fold: first, to present and analyze the theoretical aspects involved with community participation in urban development; second, to discuss the growing number of community-driven initiatives, which resulted in significant improvements in housing, and household services provision by the urban poor and for the urban poor.","KALLERGIS, ACHILLEFS",Spring 2018,"Thurs.

"POLITICAL ECOLOGIES OF FOOD, FARMING, AND CAPITALISM","This course examines the intersections of states, humans and nature through the political ecologies of food and farming inside and outside of capitalism. Political Ecology is a field that draws on critical social theory, case study research and ecological science to examine the historical processes, both natural and social, through which relations between humans and environments are formed and sustained. The course is divided into four moments. ""Foundations"" introduces macro and micro approaches to conceptualizing the intertwining of humans and nature. ""Global Structures"" examines the emergence and structural effects of monocultural capitalist agriculture. ""Agroecology as a Terrain of Struggle"" delves into the socio-technical regimes of ""modern"" and ""peasant"" farming. Finally, ""Transitions and Revolutions"" debates the potential for an eco-social agricultural regime and what that could mean for humans and the planet. Student research is focused on building political ecological case studies in which you 1) identify an ecological problem, 2) develop an historical analysis of its causes, 3) describe the political struggles around it and 4) reflect on what the future holds and what you think should be done.",Christopher London ,Spring 2018," 6:00 p.m. - 7:50 p.m.

GLOBAL FLOWS,"This course engages the core assumptions, systems, and logics that give rise to the global and provides a historically and theoretically informed basis for the further study and practice of international affairs. The terms ""global"" and ""globalization"" are relative linguistic newcomers for signifying interrelated processes that span cultures and scales. Though all movement of peoples from the earliest times can be construed as having a global effect in the most literal sense, and empires have spanned distances and brought peoples into contact, the most common referent of the term globalization concerns late 20th and early 21st century socio-economic processes. Our task in this class is to explore the key trajectories of state and market formation from which our present era has emerged, replete with paradoxes and promises. We trace how the global today unfolds from the legacies of colonialism, the nation-state system, and capitalism and manifests itself in our changing relation to space and time. These legacies are our ineluctable inheritance, our daily reality, and the material we must work with and confront, especially for students and practitioners of international affairs.","VON SCHNITZLER, ANTINA & MAHAJAN, MANJARI",SPRING 2018,"Mon.

GLOBAL POLITICAL ECOLOGY,"Contemporary global politics exists in the midst of an unprecedented era of environmental change, with issues from biodiversity loss to climate change affecting every corner of the planet. Frequently, however, these problems are considered in technical terms, as a matter of science or policy, needing simply political will to work. This course examines the relationship between politics and ecology in the global arena through the lenses of critical environmental politics, focusing on the political structures, power relations, and patterns of thought that allow these environmental problems to continue. The course will be grounded in a series of case studies from around the world, with the broader aim of teaching students to do independent research in global political ecology.","YOUATT, RAFI",Spring 2018,"Thurs.

"PLANNING SUSTAINABLE CITIES
","This reading intensive seminar introduces students to issues of urban sustainability across time, space, and scale. We examine efforts by planners, activists, policy makers, and citizens to improve the urban environment over time, as well as the role cities might play in the creation of a more sustainable planetary future. While we look to current practices in the field, we are especially concerned to untangle the multiple, often competing discursive, political, and governance systems that shape urban sustainability work. A central interest of the course is how notions of environmental sustainability relate to questions of social justice, the share of resources, and the distribution of wealth. Students engage readings and other materials from a wide variety of fields, including social sciences, humanities, arts and design. In the end, the course challenges students to reflect on how they might integrate the tools and concepts from this course into their own work.","TAUGHT BY: HEATHCOTT, JOSEPH

URBAN POLICY LAB,"This core course builds on the techniques and frameworks that were mastered through case analysis in Policy Analysis. Lab is an applied policy-analysis experience in which students work together in teams of four or five to resolve a policy issue for a public or nonprofit decision-maker. Over the course of the semester, students work on two different issues for different clients. Each experience, or ""round,"" is supervised by a different faculty member and assisted by an experienced and analytically talented second-year master's program student. At the end of each round, the client and two faculty members are briefed in an interactive setting, the team's performance is assessed in terms of its analytic strength and policy relevance, and the team then prepares written analysis in response to the feedback. Students labor under realistic constraints of limited data, time, and resources to provide rigorous analysis to clients with decision-making responsibility. The goal is to build strong analytic skills and research logic in the service of rational decision-making. This is a six credit hour course.

"CHILDREN, RIGHTS, POVERTY, EQUALITY","Why do so many millions of children suffer from deprivation, poverty, abuse, violence and discrimination? Why is inequality so extreme? What can be done at a global, national and local level? How can the state and the society take care of children on risk? These will be some of the key questions addressed and discussed during the course. The objective of the course is to analyze and unpack various programmatic approaches that are presently being implemented for children around the world. In this semester a particular focus will be on child protection and legal systems and how they work in USA and other countries. Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child will be examined and used as a paradigm and benchmark for analyzing programs. The new global agenda proposed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be critically analyzed and linked with the New Urban Agenda. Current development policies will be debated in light of children's situations and the human rights-based approach in both developing and developed countries. The course will also examine the topics of children in humanitarian emergencies, child health and nutrition, access to education, and children living in urban slums. Furthermore, students will be expected to view child rights and poverty issues through the lens of a child, creating a personal connection to coursework assignments. UNICEF senior experts and child rights practitioners will provide their experience and vision as guest speakers. It will be relevant for students to take advantage of guest speakers' knowledge. The course will be a combination of lectures, student-led discussions, and student presentations on 'child programs' case studies. Active participation and debate will be promoted, and a group assignment will include reflective interviews on childhood experiences as well as a group presentation. Students enrolled in this class will derive practical learning on issues affecting children, poverty and globalization, as well as on policies and programs created to address these problems. The goal is for students to acquire practical knowledge that can be applied in their careers going forward in the public, nonprofit, or private sector.","TAUGHT BY: MINUJIN, ALBERTO",Spring 2018,"Tues.

CREATIVE JUSTICE,"Transformative Justice builds on the cultural and social assets of a community to end all forms of violence while restoring safety and healing relationships. The arts become a powerful tool in this process by generating dialogue, strengthening a sense of community, and envisioning community based interventions. In this course, we examine how artists, cultural workers, and community activists have devised creative strategies for responding to institutional and interpersonal violence and trauma. How does creativity work to promote trust? How do the arts reveal social issues differently? Do the arts prompt more action? We start by looking at successful models of creative intervention and then consider the specific current issue of communities that have been disenfranchised by policing practices like ""stop and frisk"" and punitive criminal justice policies. We consider whether the very system that has had such a destabilizing impact on their community can also be depended upon to ""serve and protect"" that community. How might the arts intervene in this dilemma?","SPRING 2018

[DIS]ORDER & [IN]JUSTICE: INTRO TO GLOBAL STUDIES,"This class serves as an introduction to Global Studies. The focus is on the tension between order and justice as it plays out across the contemporary world, from war to migration, to the changing roles of the state, international institutions, transnational actors, and citizens. A governing metaphor for the class is the ""border"" and the ways in which it creates order and disorder in the modern system of states. We will examine the creation of the borders of countries, but also the borders between the local and the global, the legal and illegal, the licit and the illicit, self and other. These borders have intertwined histories, structures, and logic that we shall explore together. In particular we will seek to understand order as a dynamic relationship between territory, identity and belonging, and justice as a question of responsibility and ethics at the collective and personal level in an intimate relationship to forms of order. In other words, how did we get to where we are today, and what should-and can-we do about it? We will explore these topics through ""global"" perspective with an interdisciplinary focus, emphasizing the interconnectedness between global and local spaces and the impact of global issues on the real human lives that are inevitably at the center of our investigations. *A Global Studies Core Course.*","DHILLON, JASKIRAN

"ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY, RACE AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT","This course explores historical and contemporary experiences of African Americans, American Indians, European Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos in relation to the use of natural resources. We start with the contention that natural resource management is premised upon historically and culturally distinct relationships between humans and nature, and associated social and economic systems. These, in turn, are conditioned by struggles between individuals and groups over access to and control of land, water and other resources. We focus on political economy, property, ecology, identity, representation and narrative to investigate complex relationships between humans and nature, and how these have influenced urban and rural social life and landscapes. For instance, we examine how racial difference has shaped Indian rights to forest resources and management practices in northern California, Chinese American access to farmland in the California Delta, the environmental and social contexts of water management and drought in California, and divergent experiences of New Orleans residents before, during and after Hurricane Katrina.","TAUGHT BY: WHITE, MIA",Spring 2018,"Mon.

"FOOD, GLOBAL TRADE, AND DEVELOPMENT","While food security is a basic human right and an urgent global priority for people in countries rich and poor, the causes of food insecurity and the means to achieve it are subjects of intense controversy. Multiple discourses shape debates from food sovereignty and to sustainable food systems to the new Green Revolution. The role of global markets are central to these controversies, such as: How can geographical indications be used to enhance opportunities for trade? Was speculation the driver of recent price hikes in world food markets? From a cultural and ethical perspective, is the global intrinsically bad and is the local intrinsically good? Or how do global value chains help or undermine local food systems? This course, taught by two professors draws on Food Studies and Development Economics explores key policy approaches and challenges for food security in the context of the rapidly evolving global food systems. This course complements the GPIA course on International Trade.","TAUGHT BY: FUKUDA-PARR, SAKIKO",Spring 2018,"Wed.

"MUSEUMS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
","Museums are no longer content to be repositories of the past, elite centers, and exclusive spaces of privilege and authority. They have also become places where history, culture and the arts are used to promote activism, democratic participation, community engagement, civic discourse and social justice. How have museums, historic sites, arts and cultural centers addressed social issues and social change? How do these cultural spaces tackle economic, gender, racial and other social inequities, issues of oppression, civil and human rights violations? This class will examine how museums and cultural sites locally, nationally and internationally advocate, subvert, challenge and counter existing norms and unjust perceptions and policies through their exhibitions, public programming, educational vision and practices. Through several case studies, we will analyze a range of sites - from historic house museums to non-traditional art museums to national park sites to folk art museums to community history museums- which are employing innovative strategies of engagement and supporting community organizing efforts and social movement work. We will look at how museums approach issues of access, inclusion, diversity, equality and liberation. We will review groundbreaking social media and online digital campaigns. The course will investigate roles museums have played--and could play--in the fields of social justice. Students will be expected to make local site visits in their areas throughout the semester and engage in hands-on ethnographic projects

"URBAN POVERTY AND INEQUALITY
","One of the 21st century's biggest challenges is, and will continue to be, urban expansion and growing intra-urban inequalities. Fifty percent of the world's population currently lives in urban areas and, by 2050, that number is projected to rise to 66 percent. Many inhabitants, including millions of children, live in slums with precarious and temporary shelter where inequities are part of daily life. Twelve of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently adopted by the United Nations concern cities and citizen wellbeing. Some key implications of the issues listed above are still unanswered. For example, how many poor live in urban areas? How should urban poverty be measured and how reliable are current estimations of poverty? How do inequities affect different social groups in cities? What is the situation in cities, for example, of groups such as children, women and minorities? How are urban policies addressing the multiple challenges that cities increasingly face?

Urbanization and Economic Growth,"This course looks at the structural transformation of societies as they urbanize both historically and around the world. It looks at the factors that affect urbanization and the way they are linked to economic growth. It considers questions such as: Why is productivity higher in cities? Does urbanization cause growth or growth cause urbanization? How can policy-makers reap the benefits of urbanization without paying too high a cost? What should governments do to improve housing conditions? Are innovations in housing finance a blessing or a curse? and How will governments finance the trillions of dollars of infrastructure spending needed for cities in developing countries? It reviews the state of knowledge of the relationship between urbanization and economic growth. It does not have all the answers but it attempts to identify insights and lessons that have been learned to help make urbanization work as part of a more coherent, sustainable growth strategy.","COHEN, MICHAEL A",SPRING 2018,"Mon.

Is organic food better for us, or is it just a fad of the elite? Are genetically engineered products ""frankenfoods,"" or are they the key to feeding the planet? Does globalization destroy local culinary traditions or increase diversity? Can locally produced artisanal food ever replace industrial food in the world's most heavily populated urban centers? What do we really know about the relationship between nutrition and health? This course addresses political, economic, historical, social, and cultural dimensions of food.

DESIGNING SUSTAINABLE FOODSCAPES,"
This course challenges conventional notions of food in the city and examines the ways in which architects and urban designers can use it as a tool for sustainable urban development. Students learn about a wide range of urban food system innovations - from rooftop gardens and vertical farms to agriurban districts and continuous productive landscapes - and critically assess what works and why. By engaging in seminar discussions and field visits to pioneer food urbanism projects in New York City, throughout the semester, the class will explore the diverse roles that design professionals specifically can play in remaking the urban foodscape and the extent to which this can bring about more environmentally sound, equitable, and healthier cities. There will be guest lectures by sustainable food advocates from public, business, and not-for-profit organizations operating in the New York City metropolitan area.","TAUGHT BY: ILIEVA, ROSITSA",Spring 2018,"Wed.

FOOD HUBS & VBSCS,"Local food has become a mantra for many and changed the way food is being produced, sold, and even eaten. Values-based producers using environmentally sustainable practices need new ways to reach consumers interested in their products. Producers within values-based supply chains (VBSCs), and the food hubs that aggregate product from these producers, are hoping to achieve a ""new mainstream"" food system that will challenge, if not replace, the conventional food supply chain. This surveys recently published research to examine the adoption of sustainable practices among small and mid-sized farmers; compare VBSCs to mainstream food systems; explore the benefits, barriers, and concerns of VBSCs; and identify the best practices among the many recent case studies that have been published. Field trips to food hubs that are part of the VBSCs in the New York City region are possible.","TAUGHT BY: DERRYCK, DENNIS",Spring 2018,"Thurs.

We explore how current issues such as land grabbing or food insecurity in the midst of plenty are connected to political structures and relative power on the global stage. We consider how international trade agreements affect migration and labor dynamics in regional and national-level food systems. With an emphasis on sustainability and justice, we survey some of the most important challenges affecting the global food system today, including climate change; feeding an increasingly urban population; migration; gender inequity; loss of biodiversity; and declining fish stocks. We consider how global governance, agricultural development discourse, and international trade have -- and continue to -- affect these issues. With an emphasis on action and activism, we examine how international movements such as food sovereignty and agroecology are being used to design more just and sustainable systems at a global scale.","TAUGHT BY: REYNOLDS, KRISTIN",SRING 2018,,Undergraduate,Schools of Public Engagement,5563,Courses,1,0,0,1,0
URBAN FOOD SYSTEMS,"This course examines sustainability and urban food systems from farm to fork. We explore the social, political, economic, and environmental dimensions of food production, distribution, marketing, consumption, and wastes. Throughout the semester, we develop an understanding of historical and contemporary relationships between agriculture and cities, and we critically assess current alternative food concepts such as local food and regional food system sustainability; urban agriculture; food justice, and food policy in cities. Considering phenomena including climate change, rising inequality, and farmland loss, we explore the roles that urban consumers, activists, food workers, policymakers, scholars, and students play in transforming the food system into one that is more environmentally sustainable and socially just. At the end of the course, students will have a deeper understanding of the complexities of urban food systems, the politics of food in urban settings, and the role of cities in advancing food system sustainability.","TAUGHT BY: REYNOLDS, KRISTIN",SPRING 2018,,Undergraduate,Schools of Public Engagement,5748,Courses,1,0,0,1,0
URBAN RESILIENCE,"The aim of this course is to examine the past, present and future relations between cities, urbanization and nature; to introduce students to urban ecosystem science, social science and planning as lenses for exploring resilience of complex urban systems; and to encourage empirical, normative and imaginative reflection on the possibilities (and potential pathologies) that lie behind discourse of 'urban sustainability' and 'resilience'. The central objective of this course is to explore: historical and current scientific perspectives on human ecosystems and resilience; future prospects of the study of cities as ecosystems and how they can be resilient to rising urban pressures including climate change and development; key terms, concepts, frameworks, and models in urban ecology; issues involved in exploring socio-ecologies of urban systems; systems thinking and analysis. Using New York City's Jamaica Bay as a way to ground theory in practice, this course will expose students to on-the-ground resilience challenges and opportunities through a series of field visits, place-based explorations and analyses, and guest speakers. Together, we will cover such key questions as: What are complex adaptive social ecological systems? What is resilience and how are cities vulnerable to disturbances disasters and changing climate regimes? Can cities be designed as sustainable and resilient systems?

THE POETICS OF WITNESSING,"Today, many documentarians consider themselves working within a well-defined human rights framework where images and film are used to raise awareness and critical consciousness about social injustice. On the far edge of this movement, however, there are photographers and filmmakers whose work calls attention to the traditional documentary ethics of bearing witness but whose modes of representation break away from classical storytelling and linear narrative conventions. This body of work is more open-ended to interpretation and multiple readings than traditional documentary representation. And while their themes are just as serious as straight documentarians, their work engages different audiences in a variety of venues. The poetics course will study personal documentaries, essay films, assemblage techniques working with found materials, the diary and journal approach, the cine poem and other experimental forms. While not a production class per se, students usually create short poetic films for their final project.","TAUGHT BY: LUCAS, PETER",Spring 2018,"Fri.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND MEDIA,"In this course, students will study the international human rights movement with an emphasis on the crucial role that media plays in representing and responding to critical human rights issues. In the last decade, the convergence of new media technologies with the human rights movement has had a profound impact. This transformation has enabled the globalization process of human rights activism through the rapid distribution of web-based news, research, and visual representation. Digitalization has also crossed over with traditional media (television, print, film, photography, and radio) enhancing both the production and the distribution of human rights reports. The emerging interactivity between producers and consumers of human rights information is also changing as people once considered as objects of human rights reports are becoming subjects who are now creating, manipulating, and challenging dominant paradigms of media representation. This growing diversity has had serious social and cultural implications on how human rights information is received, engaged, and transformed.","TAUGHT BY: LUCAS, PETER",FALL 2018,"Fri.

GLOBAL HEALTH GOVERNANCE 1: HEALTH CRISES AND HUMAN RIGHTS,"This course examines the political economy of global health - who are the actors shaping global rules and institutions, and what tools and ideas do they use to shape the global governance of health? The last half century has seen unprecedented gains in health - driven by improving living conditions and medical progress - yet the gains have not been even. Stark inequalities mark health outcomes and the ​well being of people around the world. Understanding the ​cause​​s ​of ​ health inequities and designing relevant policies and programs demands a consideration of powerful global institutions, actors and rules that extend well outside the health sector. Advocacy for the human right to health increasingly focuses on issues such as the effects of globalization on health​, the effects of trade and investment rules, and the actions of international corporations. Global governance of health thus has to be conceptualized broadly, incorporating multiple global regimes that affect health inequalities or respond to them. Through a study of a series of topics related to emerging challenges (trade, intellectual property, food and agriculture, environment), and forms of global intervention (such as philanthrocapitalism and humanitarianism), this course examines the actors, strategies, tools, and rules that are both the drivers and responses to inequalities in health and human rights.

"DISABILITY, HUMAN RIGHTS & SOCIAL JUSTICE","In this course, we will explore two questions: (1) What is disability (2) How does (and how ought) disability inform philosophical theories of justice and social justice movements. In the first part of the course, we will examine different models of disability, from social models to medical models. In the second part of the course, we will explore the ways in which disability has informed philosophical theories of justice as well as how conceptions of disability have operated historically in social justice movements. Specifically, we will examine the role of disability in animal rights movements and movements for race and gender justice. Finally, we will examine the effects of systemic ableism, or discrimination in favor of able-bodied persons, within variety of spheres (e.g., language, feminism, bioethics, and public policy). Throughout the course, we will interrogate the relationship between disability, identity, justice, and well-being.","TAUGHT BY: DAVIS, EMMALON",Fall 2018,"Tues. Thurs.
