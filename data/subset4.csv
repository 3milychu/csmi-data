America is Hard to Find",,,,,,,,,Jeremy,1.0,,,Varon,,,,,80 Fifth Avenue,,,"I am a Professor of History at the New School for Social Research and Eugene Lang College. My main research and teaching areas are post-1945 US history, the global 1960s, the Holocaust, social movements, political violence, and human rights in the “War on Terror.”

My first book is Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies (2004). It is a pioneering work of global history that engages the parallel trajectories of “armed struggle” groups in the United States and West Germany. My second book is The New Life: The Jewish Students of Postwar Germany (2014). It examines the efforts of Holocaust survivors, when refugees in postwar Germany, to pursue advanced degrees in German universities. The book is a unique look into the fractious, postwar world and the means by which survivors gained again a sense of power, purpose, and a positive vision of the future.

My journey into academia began at Cornell University, where I earned a PhD in history under the direction of Dominick LaCapra — a towering figure across the humanities. Trained in great varieties of critical theory, I brought these to bear in my examination of left-wing radicalism. My key concerns were the political, ethical and existential appeal of violence; how past collective traumas shaped political behavior; and the need for normative limits to constrain the actions of the state and dissidents alike.

While doing research for the project, I developed my passion for oral history. Interviewing historical subjects is an unsurpassable way to engage the intimacy of lived experience. I have conducted close to 100 oral histories, and I relish teaching oral history to my students.

Working on my first book, I ran across many other young scholars fascinated by the 1960s. To give our work a platform of its own, I co-founded in 2008 the interdisciplinary publication The Sixties: A Journal of History, Politics, and Culture. I continue to co-edit the journal, which publishes exciting work on the global 1960s.

My work on the postwar experience of Holocaust survivors is a bracing inquiry into processes of dehumanization and an account of the process — often neglected in Holocaust studies — by which survivors can both reclaim the past and claim new lives. For it I did oral histories in the United States, Germany, and Israel.

I remain very active in international communities studying the global 1960s. I also remain fascinated by the origins, evolution, and success and failure of social movements. I recently co-edited a book on opposition to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the 1980s. My current book project is a study of domestic opposition to America’s post-9-11 wars. For it I am conducting oral histories, scouring the archives on anti-war organizations, and reflecting on my own opposition to the wars.

My scholarship reflects my activism, and vice versa. I am a longstanding veteran of social justice struggles. Starting in the 1980s, these include: divestment from apartheid South Africa; opposition to CIA campus recruitment; HIV/AIDs activism; the movement for global economic justice; and opposition to the 1991 and 2003 Iraq wars. Since 2005, I have been a leading member of Witness Against Torture – a grassroots, direction action group seeking to close Guantanamo prison and end US torture. My work with the group is a subject of an oral history conducted by Columbia University for its “Guantanamo Bay Oral History Project.”

Beyond my academic work, I have written essays for Public Seminar, The Los Angeles Review of Books, and Waging Nonviolence. They range from reflections on the violence of the New Left; to the fate of “war on terror” prisoners; to the engagement of torture by the arts world; to the treatment of the 1960s in pop culture such as the TV show Mad Men; to the life and legacy of iconic American radicals.

The New School is a perfect home for me, in its combination of critical inquiry, political engagement, and the idealism of the young and old alike.

Kaplan Building,,,"I am a Professor of History in the Schools of Public Engagement at The New School and the Director of the Digital Humanities Initiative. In addition to my affiliation with the History Department, I teach in the Creative Publishing and Critical Journalism M.A. at The New School for Social Research and am Executive Editor of Public Seminar. My main research and teaching areas are in United States history after 1970, political history, the histories of gender and sexuality, mass culture, media and Internet Studies. My interest in how media has shaped political culture began with my first book, War on Crime: Bandits, G-men, and the Politics of Mass Culture (Rutgers University Press, 1998.) War on Crime was the first book to show that the FBI’s militarization of popular culture in the 1930s helped to create the strong New Deal state in the public mind. Subsequently, the writing I did for an edited collection with historian Renee Romano, Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back (University of Georgia Press, 2012) brought many of the questions I had asked in War on Crime into my study of a more recent political past found in multimedia archives far more fragile and evanescent than those of the 1930s: television, digital environments, email and social media. My current research focus is on the methodologies that make digital archive useful; and on the history of putting Presidential campaigns on the Internet. My life as a historian began as an undergraduate working in the archives of Yale University. An English major in a department that prized close reading, I was poised for the innovative use of critical theory, cultural studies, gender and queer studies as these fields became important to historical study in my graduate years. A historian with an interdisciplinarian heart, I had the good fortune to write my dissertation under the direction of political historian Susan Ware and to be a member of historical sociologist Charles Tilly’s Proseminar on the State in the early years of the Committee on Historical Studies at The New School. My next major research project, Beyond Pornography: Susan Brownmiller, Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon and the Fight to End Violence Against Women, 1968-2000, caused me to dig deeply into a political world that saw media as a political problem in and of itself: second wave radical feminism. In this project, I have conducted oral histories, dug deeply into multiple archives, watched movies and television, and plunged into the debates that tore a vital social movement apart during the feminist sex wars of the 1980s. During this project, Renee Romano and I became aware how little guidance there was for historians as they tackled the archival, ethical and practical problems of writing the recent past. Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back was the result of these conversations, and is still used in graduate courses today. In 2006, I became a media participant, launching my blog Tenured Radical on a free Blogspot platform (it is now my Twitter handle). In 2011, I was invited to move to The Chronicle of Higher Education, where I wrote until I closed down the blog in 2015. During this period I made the transition to what is often called public scholarship, writing for a general audience at publications that include Dissent, The Village Voice, Inside Higher Education, berfrois, review31, and Jacobin. Currently I am the Executive Editor of Public Seminar, a web publication at The New School for Social Research where scholars write the first draft of history for a general audience. I am also the Director of the Digital Humanities Initiative, which (among other projects) hosts OutHIstory.org, a digital history platform devoted to supporting research on the LGBTQ past. My teaching reflects my scholarly commitments: to well-researched, accessibly written history; to scholarship that matters beyond the academy; to feminist and queer activist research; and to helping young historians acquire the methodological and technical tools they need to research and write the past in a twenty-first century digital world.

My current book project is tentatively entitled State of the Field: Colonial Economism and the Crises of Capitalism in Egypt, 1882-1922. It explores both the political economy of the Egyptian state and the role of political-economic thought in the struggle over British rule following the occupation of 1882. For decades now, Egypt has long appeared as a classic case of peripheral development. From this perspective, British rule simply reinforced Egypt’s prior status as a producer of raw cotton and a market for manufactured goods from Europe. All but obscured in this version of things is Egypt’s emergence as a key site for investment and experimentation in the worldwide financial expansion that characterized global capitalism at the close of the nineteenth century. State of the Field tells for the first time the story of that financial boom and the protracted crisis that followed. And it argues that this long-neglected process of financialization was of central importance to the politics of British rule. Across the three decades of Britain’s “veiled protectorate,” State of the Field traces the complex career of the discourse I label “colonial economism.” From the outset, British officials held that Egyptians, as political subjects, were capable of no more and no less than a recognition of their own bare material interests; the legitimacy of foreign rule would accordingly vary as a direct function of the “economic development” that British reform could deliver. In grappling with a discourse of colonial improvement that appeared to be succeeding on its own terms, Egypt’s early nationalist thinkers elaborated their own alternative accounts of the ephemeral and uneven qualities of financialization. They thereby articulated a range of rigorous, if fragmentary, critiques of the political-economic theories upon which Britain’s reforms had rested. In time, their efforts to find grounds for national sovereignty beyond the mere calculus of economic gain and loss influenced popular interpretations of such basic categories as crisis, progress, and independence.

Alongside this current project, I have begun work on a collaboration with my colleague Hussein Omar at the University of Oxford. Tentatively entitled The Fanatical Radical: the Life and Thought of ‘Abd al-Aziz Jawish, the project reexamines the long career of one of the most important and creative political thinkers of the early twentieth century. When mentioned at all in existing histories, the itinerant North African journalist, educator, organizer, and strategist appears as a figure of almost singular ignominy: a “violent orator,” an “extremist leader,” and a “religious fanatic.” Rather than a faithful assessment of his ideas, we argue that these labels indexed the challenge that Jawish’s idiosyncratic brand of scholar activism posed to the imperial order of his day. Like many of Egypt’s leading intellectuals at the time, Jawish was a student of Muhammad ‘Abduh, and we read his life’s work as a road not taken by modern Islamic thought, one that briefly transformed the horizons of political possibility across much of the Islamic world only to be eclipsed by the influence of ‘Abduh’s more famous disciple Rashid Rida. Finally, I have begun working on a longer-term project entitled Renting the Waters: the Suez Canal and the Production of Global Natures. It will examine the long and complex history of the Suez Canal as a vantage from which to consider the changing role of rents in the history of global capitalism.

Working in the laboratory of applied political communications with Sierra Club, ACLU, Forward Together, the National Network of Abortion Funds, Black Lives Matter Global Network, and others, Shanelle has successfully brought a scientific mindset, including novel hypotheses and custom-tailored tests, to the art and practice of storytelling in order to systematically investigate how people make positive social change.

Because Shanelle knows that a story is an embodied, full-body experience, she has given her whole self — her own story and her own body — to testing her hypotheses. After training as a media spokeperson, Shanelle understood the need for media people to have personal experience with the stories in the media. In 2016, she developed Channel Black, an immersive training program that prepares the next generation of Black, millennial spokespeople to make critical, real-time interventions on racism through the media. By working across issue areas, Shanelle has also discovered that intersectional oppression requires interdisciplinary, whole world thinking, and that we must see beyond the limitations of social power structures in order to ignite people’s psychological and spiritual power within social systems to transform our world. She is also the founder of the Radical Communicators Network (RadComms), an online and offline community of people working within social change and public interest communications who are committed to taking a radical approach to winning.

In the fall of 2017, Shanelle became The New School's inaugural Activist-in-Residence. Here she works alongside faculty and students to research and develop strategies that significantly reduce anti-Black bias. Until January 2018, Shanelle served as the Director of Communications for the Black Lives Matter Global Network, organizing to end state-sanctioned violence against Black people by building power and winning immediate improvements in our lives.

Empirically, she uses ethnography and in-depth interviewing to investigate service work, consumption, and increasing economic inequality in the contemporary U.S. context.

Her first book, Class Acts: Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels (University of California Press, 2007), draws primarily on participant observation research to analyze how workers, guests, and managers in these hotels made sense of and negotiated the class inequalities that marked their relationships.

Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence (Princeton University Press, 2017), Professor Sherman's second book, uses in-depth interviews to explore the lived experience of privilege among wealthy and affluent New York parents. The book has been covered or reviewed by the New York Times, the New York Post, the Times of London, Vice, the Financial Times, Commentary, Nature Books in Brief, and the BBC World Service. An adapted excerpt appeared at The Guardian. Sherman's essay for the New York Times Sunday Review, published in conjunction with the book, is here.

Professor Sherman has also conducted research on the contemporary U.S. labor movement; on expert service work, especially the ""lifestyle management"" industry; and the interactive artwork of Tino Sehgal.

Before The New School, Sujatha was the Executive Director of CoreAlign, a reproductive justice organization teaching innovation for social change to frontline activists, which she founded in 2012. With a focus on race and power, CoreAlign trains organizers to think and act innovatively, generate creative solutions to complex problems, and develop processes for designing solutions with their communities.

As Professor of Professional Practice in Management at the Milano School, Sujatha focuses on innovative approaches to: social justice and start-up nonprofit leadership and management; leadership, management and philanthropy at the intersection of race and gender; social justice ethics of human genetics and biotechnologies; design thinking methodologies for community engagement, advocacy and organizing; and reimagining social movements.

Over the course of the last forty years, the collective solutions that once nurtured the American middle class – including labor unions along with government and corporate-sponsored social provisions – drew increasing criticism for allegedly impeding the dynamic individualism of American capitalism. Government withdrew from social protection and provision. De-regulation and privatization swept across the domestic policy landscape. As a result, inequality increased.  And the well-being of American households was yoked ever more tightly to increasingly unregulated financial markets. These ideas, policies, and outcomes -- often labeled “neoliberalism” by scholars -- account, in part, for both the insurgency of Bernie Sanders and the shocking victory of Donald Trump. 

The past offers tools for understanding our present circumstances. And, I believe, history can guide us in navigating the future, for making the choices that are necessary to create a fair and sustainable economy for all.

Our interdisciplinary scholarship examines the social, ecological, and technical-infrastructure system (SETs) interactions that drive persisent patterns and challenges in cities.  Our goal is that by studying and visualizing SETs dynamics we hope to provide new insight into opportunities for supporting wellbeing of human and non-human species for planning and designing more equitable, resilient and sustainable cities. Rapidly expanding urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change pose potentially dramatic implications for the wellbeing of urban residents and the natural systems they depend on. Our research, from theory to practice, aims to reveal and support the social-ecological-technical system processes that together drive everyday experiences in cities and urban areas. We use both empirical (e.g. “Big Data” analysis, field experiments, spatial methods, scenario modeling) and theoretical approaches (social-ecological systems and resilience theory) as well as cutting-edge data visualization to advance urban systems research and practice. 
Our research spans a variety of urban ecological research areas, including:
Urban resilience
Social-ecological-technical systems
Urban land use planning
Urban futures and scenarios
Urban biodiversity and ecosystem services
Urban ecosystem structure and functioning
Social equity and access to urban green space

Justice 
In recent years, we have provided vital analysis to support effective public investment in mental health services for incarcerated teens, the launch of the Close to Home initiative, efforts to raise the age for prosecution as an adult, and broad public engagement on issues of incarceration and racial injustice. In the coming year, we will assess developments in policing, efforts to reform City jails, and a broad array of new programs for justice-involved youth and individuals with mental illnesses. 

Poverty 
The Center focuses on low wages, housing and homelessness, health and mental health concerns, and family violence. For decades, the Center has been a leading voice for improvements in the child welfare and Family Court systems. Building on research on brain development and toxic stress, our recent work addresses the needs of young children and includes an examination of new mental health programs for babies and toddlers, efforts to improve the quality of publicly subsidized child care, and services for young families in homeless shelters. 

Education
Our approach to education combines practical information for parents and cutting-edge policy research. Our Insideschools website provides definitive information to more than 1.8 million parents and educators each year. Recent research projects include a look at opportunities to support integrated schools in changing communities, an in-depth study of chronic absenteeism, a toolkit on implementing community schools, and several reports on gaps in math and science instruction. 

Immigrants & Global Cities 
Feet in 2 Worlds (Fi2W) works with immigrant journalists to produce news stories that express perspectives rarely featured in the mainstream press. Our reports highlight social issues, human interest stories, arts and culture, and politics. Fi2W has trained more than 100 immigrant and ethnic media journalists who work at media outlets including The New York Times, the Associated Press, public radio, and others. Current projects include examining climate change and immigrant communities, the role of Latino voters in the upcoming presidential election, and the role of food in culture and immigrant employment. 

Politics & Elections 
We have a long tradition of covering the day's most important political events at the city, state, and national level. This year, join our Politics and Policy Series, a thought-provoking and stimulating series of events featuring the hands-on experience and intellects of both American and global politics experts in order to dissect the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Check out previous events at The New School featuring Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley, top political strategists, and campaign organizers. ",,,,,"Transforming Policy in NYC
The Center for New York City Affairs at The New School is an applied policy research institute that drives innovation in social policy. The Center provides analysis and solutions. We focus on how public policy impacts low-income communities, and we strive for a more just and equitable city.

Research 
The Center’s in-depth, original, and timely studies illuminate injustices and propose workable solutions. Our investigative reports have helped shape good public policy in, for example, reducing the alarming rate of chronic absenteeism in many New York City schools, and in addressing the rising tide of children growing up in homeless shelters. We continue to break new ground in areas ranging from analyzing the persistence of racial and income segregation in public schools to chronicling the progress of juvenile justice reform. Policymakers, journalists, and others rely on the Center’s credible and well-informed work – work that not only makes headlines, but also makes a difference.

Ideas 
We identify practical solutions and fresh ideas to address pressing social and economic issues. Urban Matters is our newest, weekly outlet for ideas and insights from leading thinkers and practitioners. Read our latest posts on issues ranging from juvenile justice reform to Hurricane Sandy’s continuing impact to the racial wealth divide at centernyc.org/urbanmatters.

Action
We engage communities and policymakers and are committed to the debate of vital political and social issues. Through public events and our written work we provide opportunities for dialog. These conversations put leaders on the record, forge connections among groups, and inform ongoing policy change. We provide ‘news you can use’ — including detailed information on each and every public school in the city.",,,,,,Centers/Labs,,"Altman Foundation

The Robert L. Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies seek to develop a common language with which capitalism can be understood, analyzed, interpreted, and engaged — with rigor, with precision, and in a manner that is accessible to the broadest possible audience. Our graduate and undergraduate courses examine the basic logic of capitalism (as conceived by a range of theorists), its various historically contingent forms, and its ability to structure our political possibilities and creative endeavors. Our program supports diverse inquiries into the major structuring force in contemporary society, posing questions both timeless and pressing.

Committee Mission
The New School Social Justice Committee (SJC) initiates and promotes the efforts of students, alumni, faculty, staff, trustees, and community partners to address economic, social, and cultural divisions related to identity and to our institutional and personal practices and policies.

We work to redress the negative effects of those divisions and their intersections and to create inclusive spaces that foster the benefits of multiple social and cultural identities, life experiences, and beliefs. The SJC devotes resources and expertise to the development of new forms of access, representation, and power.

This work is built on demands for inclusion that have been voiced by university members and community partners throughout the history of The New School. We hope to address structural barriers that privilege members of some groups and to challenge the entire New School community to work in innovative and inclusive ways.
