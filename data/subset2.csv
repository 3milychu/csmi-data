I approach this broad interest in a non-traditional way. Most American political science focuses inquiry on institutions, choice, and decision-making. By contrast, I focus my attention on the ways that public meanings define the problems that the polity understands itself to share as well as the range of choices that citizens perceive to be before them. Questions that focus on the way that public meanings shape our politics require a careful engagement with public discourse, like that found in newspapers, shared through social networks online, or spoken in the meeting houses of civic and social movement organizations. These discourses provide an empirical record of what members of the polity acknowledge as politically valuable as well as clues to the logics that people commonly use to associate their beliefs and values with the problems that they recognize in the world as they find it, imbricated as it is with all the structural, institutional, group-based and affective elements of life and politics. This observation of the central practical importance of discourse to democratic politics as we actually experience it as members of the polity, leads me to utilize methodologies, both theoretical and empirical, that reveal political discourse as a practical source of information, including statistical examinations of discursive content and theoretical analyses of the meanings unearthed therein.",,,Assistant Professor of Politics  ,,,,People,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/1.jpg,40000

Working in the laboratory of applied political communications with Sierra Club, ACLU, Forward Together, the National Network of Abortion Funds, Black Lives Matter Global Network, and others, Shanelle has successfully brought a scientific mindset, including novel hypotheses and custom-tailored tests, to the art and practice of storytelling in order to systematically investigate how people make positive social change.

Because Shanelle knows that a story is an embodied, full-body experience, she has given her whole self — her own story and her own body — to testing her hypotheses. After training as a media spokeperson, Shanelle understood the need for media people to have personal experience with the stories in the media. In 2016, she developed Channel Black, an immersive training program that prepares the next generation of Black, millennial spokespeople to make critical, real-time interventions on racism through the media. By working across issue areas, Shanelle has also discovered that intersectional oppression requires interdisciplinary, whole world thinking, and that we must see beyond the limitations of social power structures in order to ignite people’s psychological and spiritual power within social systems to transform our world. She is also the founder of the Radical Communicators Network (RadComms), an online and offline community of people working within social change and public interest communications who are committed to taking a radical approach to winning.

In the fall of 2017, Shanelle became The New School's inaugural Activist-in-Residence. Here she works alongside faculty and students to research and develop strategies that significantly reduce anti-Black bias. Until January 2018, Shanelle served as the Director of Communications for the Black Lives Matter Global Network, organizing to end state-sanctioned violence against Black people by building power and winning immediate improvements in our lives.

In her work she focuses on forging unlikely collaborations and looking past forced simplifications at the intersection of issues too often considered separately: economic inequality, domestic violence, racial discrimination, disability rights and gender roles. Sujatha has worked skillfully with a wide and diverse range of leaders, community members, activists, scholars, researchers and academics, listening for patterns and trends in order to prepare for the challenges around the corner and into the future.

Before The New School, Sujatha was the Executive Director of CoreAlign, a reproductive justice organization teaching innovation for social change to frontline activists, which she founded in 2012. With a focus on race and power, CoreAlign trains organizers to think and act innovatively, generate creative solutions to complex problems, and develop processes for designing solutions with their communities.

As Professor of Professional Practice in Management at the Milano School, Sujatha focuses on innovative approaches to: social justice and start-up nonprofit leadership and management; leadership, management and philanthropy at the intersection of race and gender; social justice ethics of human genetics and biotechnologies; design thinking methodologies for community engagement, advocacy and organizing; and reimagining social movements.

Her past work ranges from community organizing in Milwaukee, to violence prevention in the South Asian American community, to reproductive justice movement building and policy advocacy on human genetics in her role as founder and executive director of Generations Ahead.

Attempting to cut through the rhetoric, the course will investigate the ""sharing"" economy to understand how smart-phones and apps are enabling the commodification of private property and the untethering of workers from traditional forms of job security, made possible by Big Data and algorithmic management. We will explore how global supply-chains make the availability and movement of commodities greater than ever, significantly impacting the power of global labor for resistance. Through the housing crisis, the course shows how financialization, debt and the dispossession of wealth from non-white bodies condition the existence of a permanent underclass of cheap labor. Other case studies will include social media as a site of data accumulation, biotech's commodification of life, and social impact bonds that financialize the population's social welfare along racialized lines.

These, in turn, are conditioned by struggles between individuals and groups over access to and control of land, water and other resources. We focus on political economy, property, ecology, identity, representation and narrative to investigate complex relationships between humans and nature, and how these have influenced urban and rural social life and landscapes.

The course will investigate roles museums have played--and could play--in the fields of social justice. Students will be expected to make local site visits in their areas throughout the semester and engage in hands-on ethnographic projects

In the first part of the course, we will examine different models of disability, from social models to medical models. In the second part of the course, we will explore the ways in which disability has informed philosophical theories of justice as well as how conceptions of disability have operated historically in social justice movements. Specifically, we will examine the role of disability in animal rights movements and movements for race and gender justice. Finally, we will examine the effects of systemic ableism, or discrimination in favor of able-bodied persons, within variety of spheres (e.g., language, feminism, bioethics, and public policy). Throughout the course, we will interrogate the relationship between disability, identity, justice, and well-being.",,,,,,,,,"TAUGHT BY: DAVIS, EMMALON",,Undegraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,Eugene Lang College Liberal Arts,Fall 2018,Courses,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/3.jpg,40000

Justice 
In recent years, we have provided vital analysis to support effective public investment in mental health services for incarcerated teens, the launch of the Close to Home initiative, efforts to raise the age for prosecution as an adult, and broad public engagement on issues of incarceration and racial injustice. In the coming year, we will assess developments in policing, efforts to reform City jails, and a broad array of new programs for justice-involved youth and individuals with mental illnesses. 

Poverty 
The Center focuses on low wages, housing and homelessness, health and mental health concerns, and family violence. For decades, the Center has been a leading voice for improvements in the child welfare and Family Court systems. Building on research on brain development and toxic stress, our recent work addresses the needs of young children and includes an examination of new mental health programs for babies and toddlers, efforts to improve the quality of publicly subsidized child care, and services for young families in homeless shelters. 

Education
Our approach to education combines practical information for parents and cutting-edge policy research. Our Insideschools website provides definitive information to more than 1.8 million parents and educators each year. Recent research projects include a look at opportunities to support integrated schools in changing communities, an in-depth study of chronic absenteeism, a toolkit on implementing community schools, and several reports on gaps in math and science instruction. 

Immigrants & Global Cities 
Feet in 2 Worlds (Fi2W) works with immigrant journalists to produce news stories that express perspectives rarely featured in the mainstream press. Our reports highlight social issues, human interest stories, arts and culture, and politics. Fi2W has trained more than 100 immigrant and ethnic media journalists who work at media outlets including The New York Times, the Associated Press, public radio, and others. Current projects include examining climate change and immigrant communities, the role of Latino voters in the upcoming presidential election, and the role of food in culture and immigrant employment. 

Politics & Elections 
We have a long tradition of covering the day's most important political events at the city, state, and national level. This year, join our Politics and Policy Series, a thought-provoking and stimulating series of events featuring the hands-on experience and intellects of both American and global politics experts in order to dissect the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Check out previous events at The New School featuring Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley, top political strategists, and campaign organizers. ",,,,,"Transforming Policy in NYC
The Center for New York City Affairs at The New School is an applied policy research institute that drives innovation in social policy. The Center provides analysis and solutions. We focus on how public policy impacts low-income communities, and we strive for a more just and equitable city.

Research 
The Center’s in-depth, original, and timely studies illuminate injustices and propose workable solutions. Our investigative reports have helped shape good public policy in, for example, reducing the alarming rate of chronic absenteeism in many New York City schools, and in addressing the rising tide of children growing up in homeless shelters. We continue to break new ground in areas ranging from analyzing the persistence of racial and income segregation in public schools to chronicling the progress of juvenile justice reform. Policymakers, journalists, and others rely on the Center’s credible and well-informed work – work that not only makes headlines, but also makes a difference.

Ideas 
We identify practical solutions and fresh ideas to address pressing social and economic issues. Urban Matters is our newest, weekly outlet for ideas and insights from leading thinkers and practitioners. Read our latest posts on issues ranging from juvenile justice reform to Hurricane Sandy’s continuing impact to the racial wealth divide at centernyc.org/urbanmatters.

Action
We engage communities and policymakers and are committed to the debate of vital political and social issues. Through public events and our written work we provide opportunities for dialog. These conversations put leaders on the record, forge connections among groups, and inform ongoing policy change. We provide ‘news you can use’ — including detailed information on each and every public school in the city.",,,,,,Centers/Labs,,"Altman Foundation

The University Social Justice Committee is made up of students, faculty, staff, and administrators from numerous colleges and departments of The New School who are invited to participate by the Provost's Office. This page is designed to share meeting agendas and notes and other key information about the committee, including subcommittees.

Committee Mission
The New School Social Justice Committee (SJC) initiates and promotes the efforts of students, alumni, faculty, staff, trustees, and community partners to address economic, social, and cultural divisions related to identity and to our institutional and personal practices and policies.

We work to redress the negative effects of those divisions and their intersections and to create inclusive spaces that foster the benefits of multiple social and cultural identities, life experiences, and beliefs. The SJC devotes resources and expertise to the development of new forms of access, representation, and power.

This work is built on demands for inclusion that have been voiced by university members and community partners throughout the history of The New School. We hope to address structural barriers that privilege members of some groups and to challenge the entire New School community to work in innovative and inclusive ways.
