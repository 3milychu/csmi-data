America is Hard to Find",,,,,,,,,Jeremy,1.0,,,Varon,,,,,80 Fifth Avenue,,,"I am a Professor of History at the New School for Social Research and Eugene Lang College. My main research and teaching areas are post-1945 US history, the global 1960s, the Holocaust, social movements, political violence, and human rights in the “War on Terror.”

My first book is Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies (2004). It is a pioneering work of global history that engages the parallel trajectories of “armed struggle” groups in the United States and West Germany. My second book is The New Life: The Jewish Students of Postwar Germany (2014). It examines the efforts of Holocaust survivors, when refugees in postwar Germany, to pursue advanced degrees in German universities. The book is a unique look into the fractious, postwar world and the means by which survivors gained again a sense of power, purpose, and a positive vision of the future.

My journey into academia began at Cornell University, where I earned a PhD in history under the direction of Dominick LaCapra — a towering figure across the humanities. Trained in great varieties of critical theory, I brought these to bear in my examination of left-wing radicalism. My key concerns were the political, ethical and existential appeal of violence; how past collective traumas shaped political behavior; and the need for normative limits to constrain the actions of the state and dissidents alike.

While doing research for the project, I developed my passion for oral history. Interviewing historical subjects is an unsurpassable way to engage the intimacy of lived experience. I have conducted close to 100 oral histories, and I relish teaching oral history to my students.

Working on my first book, I ran across many other young scholars fascinated by the 1960s. To give our work a platform of its own, I co-founded in 2008 the interdisciplinary publication The Sixties: A Journal of History, Politics, and Culture. I continue to co-edit the journal, which publishes exciting work on the global 1960s.

My work on the postwar experience of Holocaust survivors is a bracing inquiry into processes of dehumanization and an account of the process — often neglected in Holocaust studies — by which survivors can both reclaim the past and claim new lives. For it I did oral histories in the United States, Germany, and Israel.

I remain very active in international communities studying the global 1960s. I also remain fascinated by the origins, evolution, and success and failure of social movements. I recently co-edited a book on opposition to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the 1980s. My current book project is a study of domestic opposition to America’s post-9-11 wars. For it I am conducting oral histories, scouring the archives on anti-war organizations, and reflecting on my own opposition to the wars.

My scholarship reflects my activism, and vice versa. I am a longstanding veteran of social justice struggles. Starting in the 1980s, these include: divestment from apartheid South Africa; opposition to CIA campus recruitment; HIV/AIDs activism; the movement for global economic justice; and opposition to the 1991 and 2003 Iraq wars. Since 2005, I have been a leading member of Witness Against Torture – a grassroots, direction action group seeking to close Guantanamo prison and end US torture. My work with the group is a subject of an oral history conducted by Columbia University for its “Guantanamo Bay Oral History Project.”

Beyond my academic work, I have written essays for Public Seminar, The Los Angeles Review of Books, and Waging Nonviolence. They range from reflections on the violence of the New Left; to the fate of “war on terror” prisoners; to the engagement of torture by the arts world; to the treatment of the 1960s in pop culture such as the TV show Mad Men; to the life and legacy of iconic American radicals.

The New School is a perfect home for me, in its combination of critical inquiry, political engagement, and the idealism of the young and old alike.

In addition to my affiliation with the History Department, I teach in the Creative Publishing and Critical Journalism M.A. at The New School for Social Research and am Executive Editor of Public Seminar. My main research and teaching areas are in United States history after 1970, political history, the histories of gender and sexuality, mass culture, media and Internet Studies. My interest in how media has shaped political culture began with my first book, War on Crime: Bandits, G-men, and the Politics of Mass Culture (Rutgers University Press, 1998.) War on Crime was the first book to show that the FBI’s militarization of popular culture in the 1930s helped to create the strong New Deal state in the public mind. Subsequently, the writing I did for an edited collection with historian Renee Romano, Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back (University of Georgia Press, 2012) brought many of the questions I had asked in War on Crime into my study of a more recent political past found in multimedia archives far more fragile and evanescent than those of the 1930s: television, digital environments, email and social media. My current research focus is on the methodologies that make digital archive useful; and on the history of putting Presidential campaigns on the Internet. My life as a historian began as an undergraduate working in the archives of Yale University. An English major in a department that prized close reading, I was poised for the innovative use of critical theory, cultural studies, gender and queer studies as these fields became important to historical study in my graduate years. A historian with an interdisciplinarian heart, I had the good fortune to write my dissertation under the direction of political historian Susan Ware and to be a member of historical sociologist Charles Tilly’s Proseminar on the State in the early years of the Committee on Historical Studies at The New School. My next major research project, Beyond Pornography: Susan Brownmiller, Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon and the Fight to End Violence Against Women, 1968-2000, caused me to dig deeply into a political world that saw media as a political problem in and of itself: second wave radical feminism. In this project, I have conducted oral histories, dug deeply into multiple archives, watched movies and television, and plunged into the debates that tore a vital social movement apart during the feminist sex wars of the 1980s. During this project, Renee Romano and I became aware how little guidance there was for historians as they tackled the archival, ethical and practical problems of writing the recent past. Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back was the result of these conversations, and is still used in graduate courses today. In 2006, I became a media participant, launching my blog Tenured Radical on a free Blogspot platform (it is now my Twitter handle). In 2011, I was invited to move to The Chronicle of Higher Education, where I wrote until I closed down the blog in 2015. During this period I made the transition to what is often called public scholarship, writing for a general audience at publications that include Dissent, The Village Voice, Inside Higher Education, berfrois, review31, and Jacobin. Currently I am the Executive Editor of Public Seminar, a web publication at The New School for Social Research where scholars write the first draft of history for a general audience. I am also the Director of the Digital Humanities Initiative, which (among other projects) hosts OutHIstory.org, a digital history platform devoted to supporting research on the LGBTQ past. My teaching reflects my scholarly commitments: to well-researched, accessibly written history; to scholarship that matters beyond the academy; to feminist and queer activist research; and to helping young historians acquire the methodological and technical tools they need to research and write the past in a twenty-first century digital world.

My current book project is tentatively entitled State of the Field: Colonial Economism and the Crises of Capitalism in Egypt, 1882-1922. It explores both the political economy of the Egyptian state and the role of political-economic thought in the struggle over British rule following the occupation of 1882. For decades now, Egypt has long appeared as a classic case of peripheral development. From this perspective, British rule simply reinforced Egypt’s prior status as a producer of raw cotton and a market for manufactured goods from Europe. All but obscured in this version of things is Egypt’s emergence as a key site for investment and experimentation in the worldwide financial expansion that characterized global capitalism at the close of the nineteenth century. State of the Field tells for the first time the story of that financial boom and the protracted crisis that followed. And it argues that this long-neglected process of financialization was of central importance to the politics of British rule. Across the three decades of Britain’s “veiled protectorate,” State of the Field traces the complex career of the discourse I label “colonial economism.” From the outset, British officials held that Egyptians, as political subjects, were capable of no more and no less than a recognition of their own bare material interests; the legitimacy of foreign rule would accordingly vary as a direct function of the “economic development” that British reform could deliver. In grappling with a discourse of colonial improvement that appeared to be succeeding on its own terms, Egypt’s early nationalist thinkers elaborated their own alternative accounts of the ephemeral and uneven qualities of financialization. They thereby articulated a range of rigorous, if fragmentary, critiques of the political-economic theories upon which Britain’s reforms had rested. In time, their efforts to find grounds for national sovereignty beyond the mere calculus of economic gain and loss influenced popular interpretations of such basic categories as crisis, progress, and independence.

Alongside this current project, I have begun work on a collaboration with my colleague Hussein Omar at the University of Oxford. Tentatively entitled The Fanatical Radical: the Life and Thought of ‘Abd al-Aziz Jawish, the project reexamines the long career of one of the most important and creative political thinkers of the early twentieth century. When mentioned at all in existing histories, the itinerant North African journalist, educator, organizer, and strategist appears as a figure of almost singular ignominy: a “violent orator,” an “extremist leader,” and a “religious fanatic.” Rather than a faithful assessment of his ideas, we argue that these labels indexed the challenge that Jawish’s idiosyncratic brand of scholar activism posed to the imperial order of his day. Like many of Egypt’s leading intellectuals at the time, Jawish was a student of Muhammad ‘Abduh, and we read his life’s work as a road not taken by modern Islamic thought, one that briefly transformed the horizons of political possibility across much of the Islamic world only to be eclipsed by the influence of ‘Abduh’s more famous disciple Rashid Rida. Finally, I have begun working on a longer-term project entitled Renting the Waters: the Suez Canal and the Production of Global Natures. It will examine the long and complex history of the Suez Canal as a vantage from which to consider the changing role of rents in the history of global capitalism.

By contrast, I focus my attention on the ways that public meanings define the problems that the polity understands itself to share as well as the range of choices that citizens perceive to be before them. Questions that focus on the way that public meanings shape our politics require a careful engagement with public discourse, like that found in newspapers, shared through social networks online, or spoken in the meeting houses of civic and social movement organizations. These discourses provide an empirical record of what members of the polity acknowledge as politically valuable as well as clues to the logics that people commonly use to associate their beliefs and values with the problems that they recognize in the world as they find it, imbricated as it is with all the structural, institutional, group-based and affective elements of life and politics. This observation of the central practical importance of discourse to democratic politics as we actually experience it as members of the polity, leads me to utilize methodologies, both theoretical and empirical, that reveal political discourse as a practical source of information, including statistical examinations of discursive content and theoretical analyses of the meanings unearthed therein.",,,Assistant Professor of Politics  ,,,,People,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/1.jpg,40000

To answer this question my co-workers and I do controlled psychological field experiments in places around the world - like Israel-Palestine, Lebanon, or Indonesia - that oscillate between extreme conflict and surprising cooperation. Understanding what feeds into cooperation between groups, and what causes people to kill and die for a cause may help us to adjudicate the pressing problems all humans have to deal with including maintaining a sustainable environment, protecting rights of the vulnerable, and reducing conflict.",,"Sacred values and cultural conflict; psychology of political violence; religion and inter-group conflict; conflict resolution in cultural, political and ethnic disputes; consequences of long term exposure of children to political violence.","Associate Professor of Psychology

Working in the laboratory of applied political communications with Sierra Club, ACLU, Forward Together, the National Network of Abortion Funds, Black Lives Matter Global Network, and others, Shanelle has successfully brought a scientific mindset, including novel hypotheses and custom-tailored tests, to the art and practice of storytelling in order to systematically investigate how people make positive social change.

Because Shanelle knows that a story is an embodied, full-body experience, she has given her whole self — her own story and her own body — to testing her hypotheses. After training as a media spokeperson, Shanelle understood the need for media people to have personal experience with the stories in the media. In 2016, she developed Channel Black, an immersive training program that prepares the next generation of Black, millennial spokespeople to make critical, real-time interventions on racism through the media. By working across issue areas, Shanelle has also discovered that intersectional oppression requires interdisciplinary, whole world thinking, and that we must see beyond the limitations of social power structures in order to ignite people’s psychological and spiritual power within social systems to transform our world. She is also the founder of the Radical Communicators Network (RadComms), an online and offline community of people working within social change and public interest communications who are committed to taking a radical approach to winning.

In the fall of 2017, Shanelle became The New School's inaugural Activist-in-Residence. Here she works alongside faculty and students to research and develop strategies that significantly reduce anti-Black bias. Until January 2018, Shanelle served as the Director of Communications for the Black Lives Matter Global Network, organizing to end state-sanctioned violence against Black people by building power and winning immediate improvements in our lives.

She is broadly interested in how and why unequal social relations are reproduced, legitimated, and contested, and in how these processes are embedded in cultural vocabularies of identity, interaction, and entitlement. Empirically, she uses ethnography and in-depth interviewing to investigate service work, consumption, and increasing economic inequality in the contemporary U.S. context.

Her first book, Class Acts: Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels (University of California Press, 2007), draws primarily on participant observation research to analyze how workers, guests, and managers in these hotels made sense of and negotiated the class inequalities that marked their relationships.

Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence (Princeton University Press, 2017), Professor Sherman's second book, uses in-depth interviews to explore the lived experience of privilege among wealthy and affluent New York parents. The book has been covered or reviewed by the New York Times, the New York Post, the Times of London, Vice, the Financial Times, Commentary, Nature Books in Brief, and the BBC World Service. An adapted excerpt appeared at The Guardian. Sherman's essay for the New York Times Sunday Review, published in conjunction with the book, is here.

Professor Sherman has also conducted research on the contemporary U.S. labor movement; on expert service work, especially the ""lifestyle management"" industry; and the interactive artwork of Tino Sehgal. She has recently received funding from the New School Provost's Office and the Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies to conduct preliminary research on food services in the airline industry.

Professor Sherman's teaching includes courses on qualitative methods, class, work and labor, social movements, culture, and consumption.

In her work she focuses on forging unlikely collaborations and looking past forced simplifications at the intersection of issues too often considered separately: economic inequality, domestic violence, racial discrimination, disability rights and gender roles. Sujatha has worked skillfully with a wide and diverse range of leaders, community members, activists, scholars, researchers and academics, listening for patterns and trends in order to prepare for the challenges around the corner and into the future.

Before The New School, Sujatha was the Executive Director of CoreAlign, a reproductive justice organization teaching innovation for social change to frontline activists, which she founded in 2012. With a focus on race and power, CoreAlign trains organizers to think and act innovatively, generate creative solutions to complex problems, and develop processes for designing solutions with their communities.

Over the course of the last forty years, the collective solutions that once nurtured the American middle class – including labor unions along with government and corporate-sponsored social provisions – drew increasing criticism for allegedly impeding the dynamic individualism of American capitalism. Government withdrew from social protection and provision. De-regulation and privatization swept across the domestic policy landscape. As a result, inequality increased.  And the well-being of American households was yoked ever more tightly to increasingly unregulated financial markets. These ideas, policies, and outcomes -- often labeled “neoliberalism” by scholars -- account, in part, for both the insurgency of Bernie Sanders and the shocking victory of Donald Trump. 

The past offers tools for understanding our present circumstances. And, I believe, history can guide us in navigating the future, for making the choices that are necessary to create a fair and sustainable economy for all.

She works directly with impacted communities and coalitions to advance environmental justice policies,  zero waste systems, climate justice and resiliency plans, cumulative impacts tools, and mitigation strategies tied to goods movement industries. Her current research focuses on the use of municipal and state land use and zoning tools to support environmental justice goals and address cumulative environmental impacts in disproportionately impacted communities. Ana helped to develop and implement a model Environmental Justice and Cumulative Impacts Ordinance in Newark, New Jersey. She also focuses on issues related to climate justice policies at the national and state level. She is currently leading research at TEDC in collaboration with the Center for Earth, Energy & Democracy and the Urban Environment Institute at Thomas Edison State College focused on the equity implications of states climate mitigation policies. Her recent publication examines the environmental justice implications of the promotion of waste incineration and other biomass technologies in national climate mitigation strategies. Ana's research extends to issues related to environmental and health impacts of the global goods movement in seaport cities; zero waste and anti-incineration policies that can help cities transform their relationship to waste; just transition and community based resilience planning efforts; urban air pollution mitigation policies and community science air monitoring protocols; community engaged scholarship and participatory action research methods. Her doctoral dissertation focused on the implementation of state environmental justice policies across the United States, which institutionalized the environmental justice discourse absent systemic approaches to the distributive and structural roots of injustice.

Prior to joining The New School, Ana served as the Director of Environmental Justice and Community Development programs for the Ironbound Community Corporation (ICC) in her hometown of Newark, New Jersey. At ICC she oversaw a wide range of environmental justice, community development, planning and research projects aimed at implementing grassroots strategies for environmental justice. This work included: the creation of Newark's Riverfront Park, a five year community revitalization project in East Ferry Street Neighborhood, Superfund and Brownfields clean ups, community based science and monitoring initiatives, establishment of urban farming programs, environmental justice leadership training, community based climate resiliency and adapatation planning, and litigation against the state's largest garbage incinerator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for  mitigation of diesel pollution, and a natural gas power plant.

She is a political anthropologist whose research focuses on migration and its relationship to the uneven dynamics of political economic development. Her doctoral research at the University of Oxford drew on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Geneva, Australia, Fiji, and the Republic of Nauru to examine the outsourcing of asylum processes to new localities. This research generated questions on the commodification of human mobility and the challenges of social movements, specifically how oppositional strategies converge in the construction of inequality and solidification of human economies. 

Julia currently has a book manuscript under review on the consequential damages of phosphate and refugee processing in Nauru, with a focus on the relations between high-risk mineral and migrant offshore industries. She has published in Global Networks and with Routledge publication house on global migration governance and knowledge networks. Previously, she held a research appointment at Oxford's Centre on Migration, Policy and Society.

Building on her doctoral work, her ongoing research deepens the connections between human and non-human capitalist production, with a focus on the creation of special economic zones, which have been globally championed as an innovative alternative to refugee camps, as well as to protracted refugee situations.

He is a Senior fellow at “Civic City”, a post-graduate design/research program based at the Haute École d’Art et de Design (HEAD) Geneva, Switzerland and is a current fellow at the Montalvo Arts Center Sally & Don Lucas Artists Residency Program in Saratoga, California. Previously, Robles-Durán designed and directed the Masters in Science program in Design and Urban Ecologies at Parsons School of Design; he directed the Urban In-habitat unit at The Berlage Institute, The Netherlands; and co-directed the Civic City postgraduate program at the Zurich University of Applied Arts and Sciences (ZHdK), Switzerland and the Urban Asymmetries research unit at the Delft School of Design in The Netherlands. 
 
In 2008, Robles-Durán co-founded Cohabitation Strategies (CohStra), an international nonprofit cooperative for socio-spatial research and development based in Rotterdam and New York City, which focuses on conditions of urban decline, inequality and segregation within the contemporary city. CohStra has developed and designed over a dozen transdisciplinary urban projects in Europe, Asia, North and South America bringing different methodologies to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the agents affecting urban areas and structuring trans-disciplinary working frameworks and processes to catalyze grassroots led transformations. Projects include R for Republica! An urban research, pedagogical, art and performance project in a depressed neighborhood in Milan that works with elementary school kids, youth and adults to imagine a new neighborhood constitution and develop self-management strategies; Playgrounds for Useful Knowledge, an action research project for the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, which consisted of the development of an action program of participatory urban interventions; and Cooperative Housing Trusts NYC, a project commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) that proposes an alternative affordable housing model for New York City.
 
Parallel to his work with CohStra, Robles-Durán’s direct engagement with urban social movements and institutions has led him to become acting Judge at the International Tribunal of Evictions, advisor to The Right to the City Alliance, the International Alliance of Inhabitants and co-directed with the marxist geographer David Harvey the National Strategy Center for the Right to the Territory (CENEDET) in the Republic of Ecuador.

My intellectual interests and professional activities are wide ranging and cross a number of academic disciplines.  My research and teaching areas are women’s and gender history,  American cultural and social history, and the history of cities.  My first book,  When Ladies Go A-Thieving: Middle-Class Shoplifters in the Victorian Department Store, is a study of late nineteenthen century consumer culture, respectable thieves (aka  'Kleptomaniacs'), and the medical establishment.  The book has been cited as a provocative, compelling, original, and strongly feminist work.

My current book project, The Woman with Worn-Out Shoes: Gender: Homelessness, and the Great Depression, still focuses on women and cities but is a study of newly- poor homeless women and their encounter with gender stereotypes, social norms, and public policy during the catastrophic economic crisis of the 1930s.  Unlike the homeless crisis of the 1970s and '80s, these women were rarely seen on city streets nor were they standing in the ubiquitous breadlines of the period. Without  families, steady jobs or  ""a bed of their own""  they were among the most desperate of the urban population, but, in a decade of unimaginable scarcity,  were so far down in the ranks of those deemed truly needy they remained virtually invisible.

Abstract: 
According to my ameliorative definition, misogyny is, roughly, the “law enforcement” branch of patriarchy, which serves to police, enforce, or restore patriarchal social order—often by visiting hostility on girls and women for perceived violations of gendered norms and expectations. As well as complementary ideologies (most notably, sexism), there is also the flipside of misogyny which deserves to be considered: the exonerating narratives and excessive sympathy of which comparatively privileged men tend to be the beneficiaries. I call the latter ‘himpathy.’ 

This talk departs from the main example of himpathy I discuss in my recent book, Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny: that of Brock Turner, the convicted sexual assailant and then student at Stanford University. (Turner’s trial became notorious when he received disproportionate and inappropriate sympathy over his female victim from multiple sources, including the judge who found him guilty.) But, as I will argue, this turns out to be only one variety of himpathy among many. Himpathy comprises a family of emotional biases that distort our moral thought and attention in ways that not only serve to obscure, but may even plausibly cause, damaging forms of misogyny—e.g., the hostility girls and women face when they try to testify against or seek justice vis-à-vis an antecedent recipient of himpathy for his misogynistic behavior, sexual violence, and so on. The talk will close by exploring some implications of this claim about moral/social psychology for the future of the #MeToo movement.

","Book Launch: #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond
Please join us for the launch of #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond (Public Seminar Books, 2018), a collection of essays from scholars and activists about the 
""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, VA, in August 2017

#Charlottesville: Before and Beyond, a project of Public Seminar Books, is the first book to emerge from, and critically respond to, the violence that took place in Charlottesville, VA, in August 2017, when white nationalists descended on the city to protest the removal of a Confederate monument in a public park near the University of Virginia. 

The violence that ensued —  four casualties, including the murder of counter-protester Heather Heyer — left the country bewildered, angry, and frightened about ascendant racism.

The essays in #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond attempt to answer questions that still plague us after the violence of August 2017. How much is the current president to blame for the sudden visibility of white supremacist groups? What are we to do with America’s tragic racial history and relics that commemorate the violence of slavery and the Civil War? Where can we turn as political conversation stalls around these important subjects? What lessons can we learn? What are our responsibilities as citizens?

Part one of the book documents and comments upon the immediate aftermath of the violence. The essays in part two, address the context, before and after the outbreak of violence. These essays reflect on the social, political and cultural landscape of the nation, the role of the media, and the logic of “punching Nazis in the face.”

Speak-Ez: Hear The Voices of Experience
We are bombarded with shocking images of extreme weather and its devastating impacts. All life as well as what we build to protect ourselves is being uprooted, shattered. The already vulnerable are hit hardest. And we are being called on to respond to this new world.

How can we answer the call when we have cut ourselves off from fully ‘taking in’ this collective social-injustice and ecological challenge? How can we imagine what it is to have everything torn away from us by the very Elements we thought we had insulated ourselves from: fierce winds, torrential waters, mudslides, earthquakes, and raging, consuming fires.

Come experience on your own terms without crowds or observers the voices of those who have experienced Climate Disaster and Injustice in a place where you can Speak-EZ.

After winning the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015, she was assassinated on March 2, 2016. 

The film features the work of COPINH -- a grassroots Lenca indigenous organization co-founded by Berta Cáceres and OFRANEH -- a grassroots Garífuna organization led by Miriam Miranda. These visionary sister organizations are leading the struggle in Honduras to defend land, food sovereignty, and indigenous rights from corporate greed and corrupt governments.

Expanded Sanctuary will focus on the intersections between sanctuary and diverse social movements working against racism, hetero/sexism, violence and containment. What are the connections between immigration detention, deportation, dispossession, gender-based violence, homophobic/transphobic violence and the carceral state? Does sanctuary offer a vision of politics that can encompass diverse struggles and provide a basis for cross-movement coalitions? How can spaces of solidarity with undocumented people also address the broader challenges of inequality in American cities which include police violence and mass incarceration? These questions are already being probed by activists on the ground. This event is an occasion to reflect, imagine and strategize in a dialogue between scholars and activists.

","Work as Emancipation or Emancipation from Work?
The Studley Graduate Program in International Affairs presents a panel on feminist economics. 


Women’s economic empowerment has now become a buzzword both in international institutions and policymaking, with the SDGs making it a priority. Economists and policymakers have generally considered greater labor force participation as the primary channel through which such empowerment can be achieved. But is more work necessarily the answer? Considering that poor women from the South have always worked excessively long hours, that the nature of work itself is often degrading, exploitative and poorly paid, and that most women work a double day, is this emphasis on work as empowerment misplaced? Given the rapid rise of robotic and AI technologies that threaten future job creation particularly in exports, can we imagine alternative paths to economic empowerment that recognize women's 'invisible' labor? What role do a Universal Basic Income and other social protection schemes play in this regard? Is it possible to reimagine work as an aesthetic and creative category rather than simply a category of capitalist production? How can feminist economics contribute to this discussion? This panel will reflect on women and work from different perspectives and debate this issue through brief presentations and interaction.

Wednesday, October 26th from 6:30-9:00pm","Panel Will Discuss the 25th Anniversary of the 17 Principles of Environmental Justice

Can people, place, and land relationships be reassembled to create environmental justice? Can digital equity affect environmental justice? These are a few of the questions that will be asked during the panel discussion on the 25th Anniversary of the adoption of the 17 Principles of Environmental Justice. The event will explore issues of race and the environment in the 21st century, featuring a discussion with our faculty as they explore the themes of the Principles and opportunities for achieving environmental justice across different social movements, practices, and disciplinary perspectives

Delegates to the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit held on October 24-27 in 1991 in Washington D.C., drafted and adopted the 17 Principles. These Principles were created to build a national and international movement to fight the destruction and seizing of lands and communities and to secure political, economic, and cultural liberation denied for over 500 years of colonization and oppression. Since then, The Principles have served as a defining document for the grassroots movement for environmental justice.",RACE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Events,"Maya Wiley

INSTRUCTOR: TBD

",,,,"This course will examine these differing views of sustainable development both in theory and through the examination of specific development projects. Economists approach environmental questions through three differing theoretical schools: environmental economics, ecological economics, and political economics. These schools use differing techniques to value the environment, offer different understandings of what would be good environmental and economic outcomes, and advocate different policies to achieve sustainability. Underlying these differences are political economic questions of distribution of power and resources both within specific countries and globally. This course will explore the range of views, with an emphasis on understanding the assumptions underlying their disagreements, and on the policy implications of these views. Topics will include the ""green development"" policies of the World Bank, the controversial issue of water privatization, carbon trading as a response to global warming, the effects of neo-liberal policies on the environment, and cases of specific commodities such as gold and cotton which illuminate the problems and complexities of sustainable development.

The combination of urban population growth, lack of infrastructure, scarcity of natural resources, impact of climate change on resources and sea rise level, and increasing competition in usage from agriculture and alternative energy production contribute to transform existing issues into one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century. Situations are different in northern and southern cities but studying both cases will increase the global understanding of political, social, economical, technical and environmental aspects, and widen the range of the possible solutions to be implemented. In all, governance pays a key role. What is the current state of implementation of the Millennium Development Goals with respect to access to water and sanitation services? What is at stake in the privatization debate? What can we expect from technical innovations (desalination, water reuse, conservation...)? This course will provide an understanding of global water challenges, a basic knowledge of technical and economical aspects of systems of development and operation, a comprehension of water policies implemented at both local and international levels, and present through a series of case studies a range of experiences and solutions.

Governments have set up institutions (e.g., development banks, postal savings banks), as have community institutions (e.g., savings and credit cooperatives, microfinance institutions) to provide financing for priority sectors (e.g., agriculture) or populations (e.g., poor people, women). Governments have also made policies to encourage or force private financial institutions to provide the specific services to priority sectors or populations. Nevertheless, unserved and underserved populations continue to rely heavily on informal mechanisms for at least some financial services (moneylenders, rotating savings and credit associations). This course will examine public and civil society efforts to sustainably and effectively expand access to financial services for social and developmental priority purposes. It will look at issues of demand and supply, and at actual and desirable policies.

Attempting to cut through the rhetoric, the course will investigate the ""sharing"" economy to understand how smart-phones and apps are enabling the commodification of private property and the untethering of workers from traditional forms of job security, made possible by Big Data and algorithmic management. We will explore how global supply-chains make the availability and movement of commodities greater than ever, significantly impacting the power of global labor for resistance. Through the housing crisis, the course shows how financialization, debt and the dispossession of wealth from non-white bodies condition the existence of a permanent underclass of cheap labor.

In the midst of a challenging urbanization process, urban poor communities have transformed into central actors in the efforts to address the living conditions of the urban poor. An entirely new range of social movements, networks, and organizations has surfaced across the globe and within cities of the global South. The important rise of transnational advocacy coalitions coincided with a significant paradigm shift in urban governance. Ideologies of urban entrepreneurialism have led to critical shifts not only in terms of how cities are managed but also on how policy decisions are made. However, within this discussion there has been little consideration of the role of slum dweller organizations and their coalition networks in the co-production of urban entrepreneurialism. The course examines how transnational coalitions of the urban poor and their national and city-based social movements contribute in the formulation and co-production of urban policy. In what ways do communities of the urban poor contribute in the process of urban development? What are their most important contributions? What are the challenges that organized urban poor communities face?

Political Ecology is a field that draws on critical social theory, case study research and ecological science to examine the historical processes, both natural and social, through which relations between humans and environments are formed and sustained. The course is divided into four moments. ""Foundations"" introduces macro and micro approaches to conceptualizing the intertwining of humans and nature. ""Global Structures"" examines the emergence and structural effects of monocultural capitalist agriculture. ""Agroecology as a Terrain of Struggle"" delves into the socio-technical regimes of ""modern"" and ""peasant"" farming. Finally, ""Transitions and Revolutions"" debates the potential for an eco-social agricultural regime and what that could mean for humans and the planet.

Though all movement of peoples from the earliest times can be construed as having a global effect in the most literal sense, and empires have spanned distances and brought peoples into contact, the most common referent of the term globalization concerns late 20th and early 21st century socio-economic processes. Our task in this class is to explore the key trajectories of state and market formation from which our present era has emerged, replete with paradoxes and promises. We trace how the global today unfolds from the legacies of colonialism, the nation-state system, and capitalism and manifests itself in our changing relation to space and time.

We examine efforts by planners, activists, policy makers, and citizens to improve the urban environment over time, as well as the role cities might play in the creation of a more sustainable planetary future. While we look to current practices in the field, we are especially concerned to untangle the multiple, often competing discursive, political, and governance systems that shape urban sustainability work. A central interest of the course is how notions of environmental sustainability relate to questions of social justice, the share of resources, and the distribution of wealth. Students engage readings and other materials from a wide variety of fields, including social sciences, humanities, arts and design. In the end, the course challenges students to reflect on how they might integrate the tools and concepts from this course into their own work.",,,,,,,,,"TAUGHT BY: HEATHCOTT, JOSEPH

6:00 p.m. - 7:50 p.m.",,"Why do so many millions of children suffer from deprivation, poverty, abuse, violence and discrimination? Why is inequality so extreme? What can be done at a global, national and local level? How can the state and the society take care of children on risk? These will be some of the key questions addressed and discussed during the course. The objective of the course is to analyze and unpack various programmatic approaches that are presently being implemented for children around the world. In this semester a particular focus will be on child protection and legal systems and how they work in USA and other countries. Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child will be examined and used as a paradigm and benchmark for analyzing programs. The new global agenda proposed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be critically analyzed and linked with the New Urban Agenda. Current development policies will be debated in light of children's situations and the human rights-based approach in both developing and developed countries. The course will also examine the topics of children in humanitarian emergencies, child health and nutrition, access to education, and children living in urban slums. Furthermore, students will be expected to view child rights and poverty issues through the lens of a child, creating a personal connection to coursework assignments. UNICEF senior experts and child rights practitioners will provide their experience and vision as guest speakers. It will be relevant for students to take advantage of guest speakers' knowledge. The course will be a combination of lectures, student-led discussions, and student presentations on 'child programs' case studies. Active participation and debate will be promoted, and a group assignment will include reflective interviews on childhood experiences as well as a group presentation. Students enrolled in this class will derive practical learning on issues affecting children, poverty and globalization, as well as on policies and programs created to address these problems.

The arts become a powerful tool in this process by generating dialogue, strengthening a sense of community, and envisioning community based interventions. In this course, we examine how artists, cultural workers, and community activists have devised creative strategies for responding to institutional and interpersonal violence and trauma. How does creativity work to promote trust? How do the arts reveal social issues differently? Do the arts prompt more action? We start by looking at successful models of creative intervention and then consider the specific current issue of communities that have been disenfranchised by policing practices like ""stop and frisk"" and punitive criminal justice policies. We consider whether the very system that has had such a destabilizing impact on their community can also be depended upon to ""serve and protect"" that community.

12:10 p.m. - 2:50 p.m.",,"This class serves as an introduction to Global Studies. The focus is on the tension between order and justice as it plays out across the contemporary world, from war to migration, to the changing roles of the state, international institutions, transnational actors, and citizens. A governing metaphor for the class is the ""border"" and the ways in which it creates order and disorder in the modern system of states. We will examine the creation of the borders of countries, but also the borders between the local and the global, the legal and illegal, the licit and the illicit, self and other. These borders have intertwined histories, structures, and logic that we shall explore together. In particular we will seek to understand order as a dynamic relationship between territory, identity and belonging, and justice as a question of responsibility and ethics at the collective and personal level in an intimate relationship to forms of order. In other words, how did we get to where we are today, and what should-and can-we do about it? We will explore these topics through ""global"" perspective with an interdisciplinary focus, emphasizing the interconnectedness between global and local spaces and the impact of global issues on the real human lives that are inevitably at the center of our investigations. *A Global Studies Core Course.*",,,,,,,,,"DHILLON, JASKIRAN

We start with the contention that natural resource management is premised upon historically and culturally distinct relationships between humans and nature, and associated social and economic systems. These, in turn, are conditioned by struggles between individuals and groups over access to and control of land, water and other resources. We focus on political economy, property, ecology, identity, representation and narrative to investigate complex relationships between humans and nature, and how these have influenced urban and rural social life and landscapes. For instance, we examine how racial difference has shaped Indian rights to forest resources and management practices in northern California, Chinese American access to farmland in the California Delta, the environmental and social contexts of water management and drought in California, and divergent experiences of New Orleans residents before, during and after Hurricane Katrina.",,,,,,,,,"TAUGHT BY: WHITE, MIA",,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,Schools of Public Engagement,Spring 2018,Courses,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/3.jpg,40000

Multiple discourses shape debates from food sovereignty and to sustainable food systems to the new Green Revolution. The role of global markets are central to these controversies, such as: How can geographical indications be used to enhance opportunities for trade? Was speculation the driver of recent price hikes in world food markets? From a cultural and ethical perspective, is the global intrinsically bad and is the local intrinsically good?

They have also become places where history, culture and the arts are used to promote activism, democratic participation, community engagement, civic discourse and social justice. How have museums, historic sites, arts and cultural centers addressed social issues and social change? How do these cultural spaces tackle economic, gender, racial and other social inequities, issues of oppression, civil and human rights violations? This class will examine how museums and cultural sites locally, nationally and internationally advocate, subvert, challenge and counter existing norms and unjust perceptions and policies through their exhibitions, public programming, educational vision and practices. Through several case studies, we will analyze a range of sites - from historic house museums to non-traditional art museums to national park sites to folk art museums to community history museums- which are employing innovative strategies of engagement and supporting community organizing efforts and social movement work. We will look at how museums approach issues of access, inclusion, diversity, equality and liberation. We will review groundbreaking social media and online digital campaigns.

Twelve of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently adopted by the United Nations concern cities and citizen wellbeing. Some key implications of the issues listed above are still unanswered. For example, how many poor live in urban areas? How should urban poverty be measured and how reliable are current estimations of poverty? How do inequities affect different social groups in cities?

With an emphasis on sustainability and justice, we survey some of the most important challenges affecting the global food system today, including climate change; feeding an increasingly urban population; migration; gender inequity; loss of biodiversity; and declining fish stocks. We consider how global governance, agricultural development discourse, and international trade have -- and continue to -- affect these issues. With an emphasis on action and activism, we examine how international movements such as food sovereignty and agroecology are being used to design more just and sustainable systems at a global scale.",,,,,,,,,"TAUGHT BY: REYNOLDS, KRISTIN",,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,Schools of Public Engagement,SRING 2018,Courses,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/3.jpg,40000

Throughout the semester, we develop an understanding of historical and contemporary relationships between agriculture and cities, and we critically assess current alternative food concepts such as local food and regional food system sustainability; urban agriculture; food justice, and food policy in cities. Considering phenomena including climate change, rising inequality, and farmland loss, we explore the roles that urban consumers, activists, food workers, policymakers, scholars, and students play in transforming the food system into one that is more environmentally sustainable and socially just. At the end of the course, students will have a deeper understanding of the complexities of urban food systems, the politics of food in urban settings, and the role of cities in advancing food system sustainability.",,,,,,,,,"TAUGHT BY: REYNOLDS, KRISTIN",,Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,Schools of Public Engagement,SPRING 2018,Courses,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/3.jpg,40000

Time: 12:10 p.m. - 2:50 p.m.",,"The aim of this course is to examine the past, present and future relations between cities, urbanization and nature; to introduce students to urban ecosystem science, social science and planning as lenses for exploring resilience of complex urban systems; and to encourage empirical, normative and imaginative reflection on the possibilities (and potential pathologies) that lie behind discourse of 'urban sustainability' and 'resilience'. The central objective of this course is to explore: historical and current scientific perspectives on human ecosystems and resilience; future prospects of the study of cities as ecosystems and how they can be resilient to rising urban pressures including climate change and development; key terms, concepts, frameworks, and models in urban ecology; issues involved in exploring socio-ecologies of urban systems; systems thinking and analysis. Using New York City's Jamaica Bay as a way to ground theory in practice, this course will expose students to on-the-ground resilience challenges and opportunities through a series of field visits, place-based explorations and analyses, and guest speakers. Together, we will cover such key questions as: What are complex adaptive social ecological systems? What is resilience and how are cities vulnerable to disturbances disasters and changing climate regimes? Can cities be designed as sustainable and resilient systems?

On the far edge of this movement, however, there are photographers and filmmakers whose work calls attention to the traditional documentary ethics of bearing witness but whose modes of representation break away from classical storytelling and linear narrative conventions. This body of work is more open-ended to interpretation and multiple readings than traditional documentary representation. And while their themes are just as serious as straight documentarians, their work engages different audiences in a variety of venues. The poetics course will study personal documentaries, essay films, assemblage techniques working with found materials, the diary and journal approach, the cine poem and other experimental forms.

In the last decade, the convergence of new media technologies with the human rights movement has had a profound impact. This transformation has enabled the globalization process of human rights activism through the rapid distribution of web-based news, research, and visual representation. Digitalization has also crossed over with traditional media (television, print, film, photography, and radio) enhancing both the production and the distribution of human rights reports. The emerging interactivity between producers and consumers of human rights information is also changing as people once considered as objects of human rights reports are becoming subjects who are now creating, manipulating, and challenging dominant paradigms of media representation. This growing diversity has had serious social and cultural implications on how human rights information is received, engaged, and transformed.",,,,,,,,,"TAUGHT BY: LUCAS, PETER",,Graduate and Undergraduate,,,,,,,,,,,,College: Schools of Public Engagement,FALL 2018,Courses,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/3.jpg,40000
5314,,,,,,GLOBAL HEALTH GOVERNANCE 1: HEALTH CRISES AND HUMAN RIGHTS,,"Wed. 
4:00 p.m. - 5:50 p.m.",,"This course examines the political economy of global health - who are the actors shaping global rules and institutions, and what tools and ideas do they use to shape the global governance of health? The last half century has seen unprecedented gains in health - driven by improving living conditions and medical progress - yet the gains have not been even. Stark inequalities mark health outcomes and the ​well being of people around the world. Understanding the ​cause​​s ​of ​ health inequities and designing relevant policies and programs demands a consideration of powerful global institutions, actors and rules that extend well outside the health sector. Advocacy for the human right to health increasingly focuses on issues such as the effects of globalization on health​, the effects of trade and investment rules, and the actions of international corporations. Global governance of health thus has to be conceptualized broadly, incorporating multiple global regimes that affect health inequalities or respond to them. Through a study of a series of topics related to emerging challenges (trade, intellectual property, food and agriculture, environment), and forms of global intervention (such as philanthrocapitalism and humanitarianism), this course examines the actors, strategies, tools, and rules that are both the drivers and responses to inequalities in health and human rights.

It uses design as a catalyst for a form of interdisciplinary imagining that synthesizes social and political thought, world-making, and emerging technology. At its core is the idea that imagination can be a political force within society.

The main focus is on understanding, challenging and offering new examples of how technological narratives can be developed and presented through design and critical thinking in ways that challenge assumptions and inspire further imagining rather than communicating a vision of how things will or should be. It aims to contribute to a public environment where new visions can flourish, imagination thrives, and alternative technological narratives can begin to emerge more organically, bottom-up rather than top-down.

The Healthy Affordable Materials Project seeks to improve the lives and health of affordable housing residents by reducing the use of toxic materials in building products. Through the use of healthier building products and furnishings, the built environment contributes to the improved health of all people, especially lowest income communities.  

The HAMP collaborative goal is to increase the adoption of healthier building protocols and practices within the affordable housing sector, leading to measurable increase in building product specifications that reflect healthier choices. 

This change will result in reduced exposure throughout the system by decreasing or eliminating known harmful chemicals from building products and furnishings widely used in affordable housing.

Our Goals
In the broadest sense, our goals are for healthier spaces and healthier lives. To achieve this, we strive to:

1. Improve today’s commonly used materials to reduce exposure to toxics and improve health.
2. Foster knowledge and awareness of today’s healthier material alternatives—make them more marketable, accessible, and popular.
3. Invent, test, and implement tomorrow’s healthy materials.
4. Work with manufacturers to promote transparency and drive innovation.
5. Create healthier homes for people living in poverty.",,,"American Sustainable Business Council

,New School Social Innovation Initiative,,,,"The administrators of this site appreciate your feedback and information. Please email tnschangemakers@newschool.edu with any questions, comments, or concerns about building a more comprehensive information hub.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Partnerships
The New School has relationships with diverse global, national, and local organizations that provide opportunities for students and faculty to engage with the growing fields of social innovation and social entrepreneurship education and practice. Listed below are a few of our key partners.

Ashoka U Changemaker Campus Initiative
In 2009, The New School was selected to participate in the Ashoka U Changemaker Campus Initiative, a national consortium of universities. The Changemaker Campus Initiative aims to expand social entrepreneurship education across campuses and explore ways universities can become hubs for social innovation to develop solutions to diverse social and environmental challenges.

Dell Social Innovation Competition
Building the next generation of social entrepreneurs depends not just on world-class teaching and training, but also on supporting students with opportunities for strategic partnerships and start-up capital. With the goal of bringing visibility and public recognition to thousands of social entrepreneurs worldwide, The New School is partnering with Dell to participate in the annual Dell Social Innovation Competition, an international student competition that awards a $50,000 grand prize for the best idea.

Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U)
Each year, CGI U hosts a conference where students, national youth organizations, topic experts, and celebrities discuss solutions to pressing global issues. To attend CGI U, students must develop a Commitment to Action, a specific plan of action that addresses a pressing need on campus, in the community, or in a different part of the world.",,,,,"a program incubator for diverse activities that advance, broaden, and deepen social innovation–related education at the university.

The New School has long been a center for social innovation. Social innovation as a field of theory and practice is designed to enhance the capacity of individuals, communities, and organizations to devise effective, just, and sustainable solutions to social and environmental problems.

Examples of social innovation are all around us. Microfinance ventures, hospices, fair trade organizations, passive houses, and rooftop gardens are just a few of the social innovations developed by nonprofits, public institutions, and businesses.

The Social Innovation Initiative was established in 2011 with support from the Provost's Office and the deans of the New School for Public Engagement, Parsons The New School for Design, and Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts. The Social Innovation Initiative offers opportunities for students and faculty from different colleges of The New School to participate in interdisciplinary learning, research, and practice that contributes to real-world problem solving. Through courses, workshops, conferences, and an innovation competition, we equip students to address contemporary environmental and social challenges in innovative ways, whatever their career paths may be.

Our partnerships with global organizations such as Ashoka U and Dell Social Innovation Challenge as well as with many local and national community, cultural, and civic partners strengthen our work and offer our students numerous opportunities beyond the walls of The New School.

The New School’s unique approach to social innovation education relies on collaboration between several schools:

New York City",,"Vision
DESIS Lab members explore the relationship between design and social change. Our goal is to advance the practice and discourse of design-led social innovation to foster more equitable and sustainable cities and practices. In a complex world facing numerous systemic challenges, DESIS Lab members rethink assumptions about cultural and economic environments, bringing nuanced approaches drawn from integrated design practices to communities of all kinds. In the DESIS Lab, service design is considered an advanced approach, one integrating many design disciplines.

Foundations
Three foundations guide our research in design strategies:

Bridging structural holes: Social settings often suffer from severe information asymmetries. We seek to bridge information gaps and find ways of sharing needed information more effectively.
Valuing tacit knowledge: People in a social system rely on both explicit forms of knowledge and “tacit knowledge”—information individuals and communities develop and share through habits and customs. The use of participatory design methods reveals and codifies this subjective knowledge.
Nurturing heterarchies: Whereas researchers have focused on social hierarchies and structural asymmetries, little attention has been paid to heterarchies—the lateral forms of collaboration through which social life is constructed. We promote such interdependent networks as it generates more opportunities for heterogeneous forms of collaboration.
Local and Global
The lab works with local partners in New York City and with global partners through the DESIS Network, participating in large-scale research programs and projects to effect social change. The DESIS Network consists of more than 30 design labs based in universities around the world that orient their teaching and research activities towards social innovation and sustainability. DESIS processes and initiatives involve the following:

Collecting social innovation practices and generating greater visibility for them
Promoting collaborative projects and organizing academic events to explore these practices
Developing teaching tools and co-producing courses internationally to showcase these practices and their contextual variations
Carrying out comparative research programs to track these practices and their outcomes  AMPLIFYING CREATIVE COMMUNITIES IN NEW YORK CITY
Launched in 2009 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this initiative investigates ways design can be used to amplify community-led approaches to sustainable living in New York City.

Visit the Amplifying Creative Communities website for more information.

PUBLIC & COLLABORATIVE
Launched in 2011 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this multi-project initiative investigates the role design can play in building bridges between government and people, allowing for socially innovative methods of providing services for the public good.

Visit the Public & Collaborative website for more information.

DESIGNING FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT
Launched in 2014 with the support of Citi Community Development, Designing for Financial Empowerment is a cross-sector initiative to explore how service design can be used to make public sector financial empowerment services more effective and accessible.

The New School will disrupt regular curriculum across the University in order to learn about climate change and its implications, particularly the unequal and devastating impacts on the most vulnerable and least responsible communities around the globe. This disruption is an opportunity to come together to take concrete action toward fighting climate change and supporting climate justice.

By interrupting “business as usual” across the University, and engaging in a series of service, learning, and action opportunities, we will:
Make visible the climate crisis
Highlight the unequal impacts on vulnerable communities
Reflect on and deepen understanding of the importance of just and equitable solutions
Build coalitions and partnerships

Sustainability Learning Outcomes
Working closely with the leadership and faculty at all five schools at the New School, the Tishman Center is embarking on a multi-year project to incorporate sustainability learning outcomes that account for the social, political, and economic dimensions of environmental issues into the academic experience of all New School students. 

In collaboration with our Affiliated Faculty, the Tishman Center is exploring strategies to uplift existing sustainability-related course offerings, design new methods of engaging students in sustainability learning, and partner with community organizations to provide real-world learning experiences for students. We are developing and delivering opportunities for all students to learn about sustainability in ways that fit and complement their majors and disciplines from jazz to design, liberal arts to social research, and beyond.

The Tishman Center is committed to fostering an environmental philosophy and an understanding of sustainability that digs deeper than simply championing the concepts of being ""green"" or ""eco-friendly."" At the Tishman Center and The New School, sustainability is truly cross-disciplinary, incorporating and collaborative space that brings together stakeholders from a variety of disciplines, schools, and populations. It will be a communication bridge between the university's operational sustainability efforts and the university community.

Justice 
In recent years, we have provided vital analysis to support effective public investment in mental health services for incarcerated teens, the launch of the Close to Home initiative, efforts to raise the age for prosecution as an adult, and broad public engagement on issues of incarceration and racial injustice. In the coming year, we will assess developments in policing, efforts to reform City jails, and a broad array of new programs for justice-involved youth and individuals with mental illnesses. 

Poverty 
The Center focuses on low wages, housing and homelessness, health and mental health concerns, and family violence. For decades, the Center has been a leading voice for improvements in the child welfare and Family Court systems. Building on research on brain development and toxic stress, our recent work addresses the needs of young children and includes an examination of new mental health programs for babies and toddlers, efforts to improve the quality of publicly subsidized child care, and services for young families in homeless shelters. 

Education
Our approach to education combines practical information for parents and cutting-edge policy research. Our Insideschools website provides definitive information to more than 1.8 million parents and educators each year. Recent research projects include a look at opportunities to support integrated schools in changing communities, an in-depth study of chronic absenteeism, a toolkit on implementing community schools, and several reports on gaps in math and science instruction. 

Immigrants & Global Cities 
Feet in 2 Worlds (Fi2W) works with immigrant journalists to produce news stories that express perspectives rarely featured in the mainstream press. Our reports highlight social issues, human interest stories, arts and culture, and politics. Fi2W has trained more than 100 immigrant and ethnic media journalists who work at media outlets including The New York Times, the Associated Press, public radio, and others. Current projects include examining climate change and immigrant communities, the role of Latino voters in the upcoming presidential election, and the role of food in culture and immigrant employment. 

Politics & Elections 
We have a long tradition of covering the day's most important political events at the city, state, and national level. This year, join our Politics and Policy Series, a thought-provoking and stimulating series of events featuring the hands-on experience and intellects of both American and global politics experts in order to dissect the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Check out previous events at The New School featuring Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley, top political strategists, and campaign organizers. ",,,,,"Transforming Policy in NYC
The Center for New York City Affairs at The New School is an applied policy research institute that drives innovation in social policy. The Center provides analysis and solutions. We focus on how public policy impacts low-income communities, and we strive for a more just and equitable city.

Research 
The Center’s in-depth, original, and timely studies illuminate injustices and propose workable solutions. Our investigative reports have helped shape good public policy in, for example, reducing the alarming rate of chronic absenteeism in many New York City schools, and in addressing the rising tide of children growing up in homeless shelters. We continue to break new ground in areas ranging from analyzing the persistence of racial and income segregation in public schools to chronicling the progress of juvenile justice reform. Policymakers, journalists, and others rely on the Center’s credible and well-informed work – work that not only makes headlines, but also makes a difference.

Ideas 
We identify practical solutions and fresh ideas to address pressing social and economic issues. Urban Matters is our newest, weekly outlet for ideas and insights from leading thinkers and practitioners. Read our latest posts on issues ranging from juvenile justice reform to Hurricane Sandy’s continuing impact to the racial wealth divide at centernyc.org/urbanmatters.

Action
We engage communities and policymakers and are committed to the debate of vital political and social issues. Through public events and our written work we provide opportunities for dialog. These conversations put leaders on the record, forge connections among groups, and inform ongoing policy change. We provide ‘news you can use’ — including detailed information on each and every public school in the city.",,,,,,Centers/Labs,,"Altman Foundation

Our graduate and undergraduate courses examine the basic logic of capitalism (as conceived by a range of theorists), its various historically contingent forms, and its ability to structure our political possibilities and creative endeavors. Our program supports diverse inquiries into the major structuring force in contemporary society, posing questions both timeless and pressing.

Committee Mission
The New School Social Justice Committee (SJC) initiates and promotes the efforts of students, alumni, faculty, staff, trustees, and community partners to address economic, social, and cultural divisions related to identity and to our institutional and personal practices and policies.

We work to redress the negative effects of those divisions and their intersections and to create inclusive spaces that foster the benefits of multiple social and cultural identities, life experiences, and beliefs. The SJC devotes resources and expertise to the development of new forms of access, representation, and power.

This work is built on demands for inclusion that have been voiced by university members and community partners throughout the history of The New School. We hope to address structural barriers that privilege members of some groups and to challenge the entire New School community to work in innovative and inclusive ways.

While yielding more comprehensive, in-depth explanations of processes taking place in today's world, the transregional approach encourages and facilitates the quest for consensus among peoples separated by divergent histories, cultures, and economies.

An core belief at TCDS is that adequate social and human capital is an essential element in forming and consolidating democratic governance. One proven cost-effective and valid method of cultivating this capital is to invest in the academic and professional development of, and collaboration with, civic-minded graduate students and junior faculty members at universities here and abroad. TCDS's programs, always open to the broad interests of our students and faculty and inspired by world events, have been engaged primarily with five regions: Central and Eastern Europe; Central Asia and the Caucasus; Sub-Saharan Africa; Latin America; and North America.

TCDS's initiatives have led to the emergence and cultivation of extensive scholarly networks in these regions, bringing young scholars and civically committed academics together with the graduate students of the NSSR. There are many ways to get involved with TCDS, including applying to our Democracy &amp; Diversity graduate summer institutes (held annually in July in Wroclaw, Poland and January in Johannesburg, South Africa) for the opportunity to study directly with colleagues from those regions; attending our lectures, events and conferences at the New School; and by becoming a TCDS Associate.",,,,,"The Transregional Center for Democratic Studies (TCDS) builds on international and interdisciplinary traditions that The New School for Social Research (NSSR) inherited from the University in Exile, which was established at The New School in 1933. TCDS was founded in 1990, inspired by the peaceful dismantling of communism in Eastern Europe, and has been directed from the start by Elzbieta Matynia, associate professor of Sociology at The New School for Social Research. The center offers unique opportunities for global advanced research and cross-cultural collaboration. Its projects address democratic transitions, the workings of collective memory, and—increasingly important in times of massive migrations—the development of a ""culture of borderlands"" and an ""ethos of border thinking"" in order to promote a general openness to difference, hybridity, and diversity in civil society and civic life.
