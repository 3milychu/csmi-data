His current research, teaching and creative practice engages the critical role of technology, civic media, and artistic interventions in contested spaces. He examines social movements and crisis contexts, though forms of creative urban tactics, participatory research, performance and documentary film.

Nitin completed his doctoral degree at the MIT Media Lab, where he conducted research on networked collaboration for sustainable product design, ubiquitous and wearable computing, speech/auditory interfaces, and responsive media in urban community spaces. He co-founded Akaza Research, a startup software firm, to develop open source tools and online repositories for public biomedical research with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and directed new product development at Cytel, Inc. for statistical simulation tools to support adaptive clinical trials.

Nitin is a research affiliate with the MIT Center for Civic Media, where he co-founded the Department of Play, a research collaborative, to design participatory mobile video, mapping and pedagogical tools to support creative expression and civic agency among marginalized youth. Nitin was awarded a Visionary Fellowship at MIT in 2008 with the Jerusalem 2050 Project at the Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning and the Center for International Studies, conducting research on urban renewal and civic engagement through the media arts in divided cities such as Belfast and Jerusalem. His current work includes OccupyData Hackathons to facilitate participatory data-driven activism, and developing a collaborative online platform and place-based initiative, MikroAct, to support urban tactics and civic action in neighborhoods of Moscow and NYC. He recently conducted workshops in Moscow examining Invisible Borders in the city.

Since 2006 he has conducted research and digital storytelling initiatives (Voices Beyond Walls) with Palestinian youth in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shanelle,1.0,,,Matthews,,,,,,,,"Part social science iconoclast, part feminist theory maven, Shanelle Matthews has spent the last decade injecting social justice movement work with a much-needed dose of strategic and tactical experimentation. Working in the laboratory of applied political communications with Sierra Club, ACLU, Forward Together, the National Network of Abortion Funds, Black Lives Matter Global Network, and others, Shanelle has successfully brought a scientific mindset, including novel hypotheses and custom-tailored tests, to the art and practice of storytelling in order to systematically investigate how people make positive social change.

Because Shanelle knows that a story is an embodied, full-body experience, she has given her whole self — her own story and her own body — to testing her hypotheses. After training as a media spokeperson, Shanelle understood the need for media people to have personal experience with the stories in the media. In 2016, she developed Channel Black, an immersive training program that prepares the next generation of Black, millennial spokespeople to make critical, real-time interventions on racism through the media. By working across issue areas, Shanelle has also discovered that intersectional oppression requires interdisciplinary, whole world thinking, and that we must see beyond the limitations of social power structures in order to ignite people’s psychological and spiritual power within social systems to transform our world. She is also the founder of the Radical Communicators Network (RadComms), an online and offline community of people working within social change and public interest communications who are committed to taking a radical approach to winning.

In the fall of 2017, Shanelle became The New School's inaugural Activist-in-Residence. Here she works alongside faculty and students to research and develop strategies that significantly reduce anti-Black bias. Until January 2018, Shanelle served as the Director of Communications for the Black Lives Matter Global Network, organizing to end state-sanctioned violence against Black people by building power and winning immediate improvements in our lives.

Shanelle holds a degree in Journalism and New and Online Media from the Manship School of Mass Communications at Louisiana State University.",,,Activist In Residence,,,,People,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/1.jpg,40000

Qualitative Research PhD ",,,,,,,,,Sujatha,1.0,,,Jesudason,,,,,72 5th Ave,,,"Sujatha Jesudason, Ph.D. has worked as an activist, organizer and scholar for over 25 years in a range of social justice movements. She is a leading voice on new practices in movement building, the ethics of reproductive genetics, gender justice, disability rights and racial inclusion.

In her work she focuses on forging unlikely collaborations and looking past forced simplifications at the intersection of issues too often considered separately: economic inequality, domestic violence, racial discrimination, disability rights and gender roles. Sujatha has worked skillfully with a wide and diverse range of leaders, community members, activists, scholars, researchers and academics, listening for patterns and trends in order to prepare for the challenges around the corner and into the future.

Before The New School, Sujatha was the Executive Director of CoreAlign, a reproductive justice organization teaching innovation for social change to frontline activists, which she founded in 2012. With a focus on race and power, CoreAlign trains organizers to think and act innovatively, generate creative solutions to complex problems, and develop processes for designing solutions with their communities.

As Professor of Professional Practice in Management at the Milano School, Sujatha focuses on innovative approaches to: social justice and start-up nonprofit leadership and management; leadership, management and philanthropy at the intersection of race and gender; social justice ethics of human genetics and biotechnologies; design thinking methodologies for community engagement, advocacy and organizing; and reimagining social movements.

Her past work ranges from community organizing in Milwaukee, to violence prevention in the South Asian American community, to reproductive justice movement building and policy advocacy on human genetics in her role as founder and executive director of Generations Ahead.

Sujatha holds a Master’s and a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Berkeley and an undergraduate degree in Economics and Latin American Studies from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

We will spend some time understanding the extent to which traditional financial institutions (such as banks) and strategies serve (or do not serve) this group. We will look at relevant recent trends, such as the rise of fringe financial services that include check cashers and payday lenders. We will also examine alternative financial strategies, such as microenterprise development and individual development accounts (IDAs) that serve low-income people differently, and study best practices from the US and abroad.

While we look to current practices in the field, we are especially concerned to untangle the multiple, often competing discursive, political, and governance systems that shape urban sustainability work. A central interest of the course is how notions of environmental sustainability relate to questions of social justice, the share of resources, and the distribution of wealth.

The arts become a powerful tool in this process by generating dialogue, strengthening a sense of community, and envisioning community based interventions. In this course, we examine how artists, cultural workers, and community activists have devised creative strategies for responding to institutional and interpersonal violence and trauma. How does creativity work to promote trust? How do the arts reveal social issues differently? Do the arts prompt more action? We start by looking at successful models of creative intervention and then consider the specific current issue of communities that have been disenfranchised by policing practices like ""stop and frisk"" and punitive criminal justice policies. We consider whether the very system that has had such a destabilizing impact on their community can also be depended upon to ""serve and protect"" that community.

Students learn about a wide range of urban food system innovations - from rooftop gardens and vertical farms to agriurban districts and continuous productive landscapes - and critically assess what works and why. By engaging in seminar discussions and field visits to pioneer food urbanism projects in New York City, throughout the semester, the class will explore the diverse roles that design professionals specifically can play in remaking the urban foodscape and the extent to which this can bring about more environmentally sound, equitable, and healthier cities.

On the far edge of this movement, however, there are photographers and filmmakers whose work calls attention to the traditional documentary ethics of bearing witness but whose modes of representation break away from classical storytelling and linear narrative conventions. This body of work is more open-ended to interpretation and multiple readings than traditional documentary representation. And while their themes are just as serious as straight documentarians, their work engages different audiences in a variety of venues. The poetics course will study personal documentaries, essay films, assemblage techniques working with found materials, the diary and journal approach, the cine poem and other experimental forms.

In the last decade, the convergence of new media technologies with the human rights movement has had a profound impact. This transformation has enabled the globalization process of human rights activism through the rapid distribution of web-based news, research, and visual representation. Digitalization has also crossed over with traditional media (television, print, film, photography, and radio) enhancing both the production and the distribution of human rights reports. The emerging interactivity between producers and consumers of human rights information is also changing as people once considered as objects of human rights reports are becoming subjects who are now creating, manipulating, and challenging dominant paradigms of media representation.

The New School has relationships with diverse global, national, and local organizations that provide opportunities for students and faculty to engage with the growing fields of social innovation and social entrepreneurship education and practice. Listed below are a few of our key partners.

Ashoka U Changemaker Campus Initiative
In 2009, The New School was selected to participate in the Ashoka U Changemaker Campus Initiative, a national consortium of universities. The Changemaker Campus Initiative aims to expand social entrepreneurship education across campuses and explore ways universities can become hubs for social innovation to develop solutions to diverse social and environmental challenges.

Dell Social Innovation Competition
Building the next generation of social entrepreneurs depends not just on world-class teaching and training, but also on supporting students with opportunities for strategic partnerships and start-up capital. With the goal of bringing visibility and public recognition to thousands of social entrepreneurs worldwide, The New School is partnering with Dell to participate in the annual Dell Social Innovation Competition, an international student competition that awards a $50,000 grand prize for the best idea.

Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U)
Each year, CGI U hosts a conference where students, national youth organizations, topic experts, and celebrities discuss solutions to pressing global issues. To attend CGI U, students must develop a Commitment to Action, a specific plan of action that addresses a pressing need on campus, in the community, or in a different part of the world.",,,,,"a program incubator for diverse activities that advance, broaden, and deepen social innovation–related education at the university.

The New School has long been a center for social innovation. Social innovation as a field of theory and practice is designed to enhance the capacity of individuals, communities, and organizations to devise effective, just, and sustainable solutions to social and environmental problems.

Examples of social innovation are all around us. Microfinance ventures, hospices, fair trade organizations, passive houses, and rooftop gardens are just a few of the social innovations developed by nonprofits, public institutions, and businesses.

The Social Innovation Initiative was established in 2011 with support from the Provost's Office and the deans of the New School for Public Engagement, Parsons The New School for Design, and Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts. The Social Innovation Initiative offers opportunities for students and faculty from different colleges of The New School to participate in interdisciplinary learning, research, and practice that contributes to real-world problem solving. Through courses, workshops, conferences, and an innovation competition, we equip students to address contemporary environmental and social challenges in innovative ways, whatever their career paths may be.

Our partnerships with global organizations such as Ashoka U and Dell Social Innovation Challenge as well as with many local and national community, cultural, and civic partners strengthen our work and offer our students numerous opportunities beyond the walls of The New School.

The New School’s unique approach to social innovation education relies on collaboration between several schools:

New York City",,"Vision
DESIS Lab members explore the relationship between design and social change. Our goal is to advance the practice and discourse of design-led social innovation to foster more equitable and sustainable cities and practices. In a complex world facing numerous systemic challenges, DESIS Lab members rethink assumptions about cultural and economic environments, bringing nuanced approaches drawn from integrated design practices to communities of all kinds. In the DESIS Lab, service design is considered an advanced approach, one integrating many design disciplines.

Foundations
Three foundations guide our research in design strategies:

Bridging structural holes: Social settings often suffer from severe information asymmetries. We seek to bridge information gaps and find ways of sharing needed information more effectively.
Valuing tacit knowledge: People in a social system rely on both explicit forms of knowledge and “tacit knowledge”—information individuals and communities develop and share through habits and customs. The use of participatory design methods reveals and codifies this subjective knowledge.
Nurturing heterarchies: Whereas researchers have focused on social hierarchies and structural asymmetries, little attention has been paid to heterarchies—the lateral forms of collaboration through which social life is constructed. We promote such interdependent networks as it generates more opportunities for heterogeneous forms of collaboration.
Local and Global
The lab works with local partners in New York City and with global partners through the DESIS Network, participating in large-scale research programs and projects to effect social change. The DESIS Network consists of more than 30 design labs based in universities around the world that orient their teaching and research activities towards social innovation and sustainability. DESIS processes and initiatives involve the following:

Collecting social innovation practices and generating greater visibility for them
Promoting collaborative projects and organizing academic events to explore these practices
Developing teaching tools and co-producing courses internationally to showcase these practices and their contextual variations
Carrying out comparative research programs to track these practices and their outcomes  AMPLIFYING CREATIVE COMMUNITIES IN NEW YORK CITY
Launched in 2009 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this initiative investigates ways design can be used to amplify community-led approaches to sustainable living in New York City.

PUBLIC & COLLABORATIVE
Launched in 2011 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this multi-project initiative investigates the role design can play in building bridges between government and people, allowing for socially innovative methods of providing services for the public good.

Visit the Public & Collaborative website for more information.

DESIGNING FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT
Launched in 2014 with the support of Citi Community Development, Designing for Financial Empowerment is a cross-sector initiative to explore how service design can be used to make public sector financial empowerment services more effective and accessible.

Our interdisciplinary scholarship examines the social, ecological, and technical-infrastructure system (SETs) interactions that drive persisent patterns and challenges in cities.  Our goal is that by studying and visualizing SETs dynamics we hope to provide new insight into opportunities for supporting wellbeing of human and non-human species for planning and designing more equitable, resilient and sustainable cities. Rapidly expanding urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change pose potentially dramatic implications for the wellbeing of urban residents and the natural systems they depend on. Our research, from theory to practice, aims to reveal and support the social-ecological-technical system processes that together drive everyday experiences in cities and urban areas. We use both empirical (e.g. “Big Data” analysis, field experiments, spatial methods, scenario modeling) and theoretical approaches (social-ecological systems and resilience theory) as well as cutting-edge data visualization to advance urban systems research and practice. 
Our research spans a variety of urban ecological research areas, including:
