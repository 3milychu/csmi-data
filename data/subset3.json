Our goal is to advance the practice and discourse of design-led social innovation to foster more equitable and sustainable cities and practices. In a complex world facing numerous systemic challenges, DESIS Lab members rethink assumptions about cultural and economic environments, bringing nuanced approaches drawn from integrated design practices to communities of all kinds. In the DESIS Lab, service design is considered an advanced approach, one integrating many design disciplines.\n\nFoundations\nThree foundations guide our research in design strategies:\n\nBridging structural holes: Social settings often suffer from severe information asymmetries. We seek to bridge information gaps and find ways of sharing needed information more effectively.\nValuing tacit knowledge: People in a social system rely on both explicit forms of knowledge and \u201ctacit knowledge\u201d\u2014information individuals and communities develop and share through habits and customs. The use of participatory design methods reveals and codifies this subjective knowledge.\nNurturing heterarchies: Whereas researchers have focused on social hierarchies and structural asymmetries, little attention has been paid to heterarchies\u2014the lateral forms of collaboration through which social life is constructed. We promote such interdependent networks as it generates more opportunities for heterogeneous forms of collaboration.\nLocal and Global\nThe lab works with local partners in New York City and with global partners through the DESIS Network, participating in large-scale research programs and projects to effect social change. The DESIS Network consists of more than 30 design labs based in universities around the world that orient their teaching and research activities towards social innovation and sustainability. DESIS processes and initiatives involve the following:\n\nCollecting social innovation practices and generating greater visibility for them\nPromoting collaborative projects and organizing academic events to explore these practices\nDeveloping teaching tools and co-producing courses internationally to showcase these practices and their contextual variations\nCarrying out comparative research programs to track these practices and their outcomes  AMPLIFYING CREATIVE COMMUNITIES IN NEW YORK CITY\nLaunched in 2009 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this initiative investigates ways design can be used to amplify community-led approaches to sustainable living in New York City.\n\nVisit the Amplifying Creative Communities website for more information.\n\nPUBLIC & COLLABORATIVE\nLaunched in 2011 with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, this multi-project initiative investigates the role design can play in building bridges between government and people, allowing for socially innovative methods of providing services for the public good.\n\nVisit the Public & Collaborative website for more information.\n\nDESIGNING FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT\nLaunched in 2014 with the support of Citi Community Development, Designing for Financial Empowerment is a cross-sector initiative to explore how service design can be used to make public sector financial empowerment services more effective and accessible.
