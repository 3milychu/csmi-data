Unlike the homeless crisis of the 1970s and '80s, these women were rarely seen on city streets nor were they standing in the ubiquitous breadlines of the period.

It explores both the political economy of the Egyptian state and the role of political-economic thought in the struggle over British rule following the occupation of 1882. For decades now, Egypt has long appeared as a classic case of peripheral development. From this perspective, British rule simply reinforced Egypt\u2019s prior status as a producer of raw cotton and a market for manufactured goods from Europe. All but obscured in this version of things is Egypt\u2019s emergence as a key site for investment and experimentation in the worldwide financial expansion that characterized global capitalism at the close of the nineteenth century. State of the Field tells for the first time the story of that financial boom and the protracted crisis that followed. And it argues that this long-neglected process of financialization was of central importance to the politics of British rule. Across the three decades of Britain\u2019s \u201cveiled protectorate,\u201d State of the Field traces the complex career of the discourse I label \u201ccolonial economism.\u201d From the outset, British officials held that Egyptians, as political subjects, were capable of no more and no less than a recognition of their own bare material interests; the legitimacy of foreign rule would accordingly vary as a direct function of the \u201ceconomic development\u201d that British reform could deliver. In grappling with a discourse of colonial improvement that appeared to be succeeding on its own terms, Egypt\u2019s early nationalist thinkers elaborated their own alternative accounts of the ephemeral and uneven qualities of financialization. They thereby articulated a range of rigorous, if fragmentary, critiques of the political-economic theories upon which Britain\u2019s reforms had rested. In time, their efforts to find grounds for national sovereignty beyond the mere calculus of economic gain and loss influenced popular interpretations of such basic categories as crisis, progress, and independence.\n\nAlongside this current project, I have begun work on a collaboration with my colleague Hussein Omar at the University of Oxford. Tentatively entitled The Fanatical Radical: the Life and Thought of \u2018Abd al-Aziz Jawish, the project reexamines the long career of one of the most important and creative political thinkers of the early twentieth century. When mentioned at all in existing histories, the itinerant North African journalist, educator, organizer, and strategist appears as a figure of almost singular ignominy: a \u201cviolent orator,\u201d an \u201cextremist leader,\u201d and a \u201creligious fanatic.\u201d Rather than a faithful assessment of his ideas, we argue that these labels indexed the challenge that Jawish\u2019s idiosyncratic brand of scholar activism posed to the imperial order of his day. Like many of Egypt\u2019s leading intellectuals at the time, Jawish was a student of Muhammad \u2018Abduh, and we read his life\u2019s work as a road not taken by modern Islamic thought, one that briefly transformed the horizons of political possibility across much of the Islamic world only to be eclipsed by the influence of \u2018Abduh\u2019s more famous disciple Rashid Rida. Finally, I have begun working on a longer-term project entitled Renting the Waters: the Suez Canal and the Production of Global Natures. It will examine the long and complex history of the Suez Canal as a vantage from which to consider the changing role of rents in the history of global capitalism.

Over the course of the last forty years, the collective solutions that once nurtured the American middle class \u2013 including labor unions along with government and corporate-sponsored social provisions \u2013 drew increasing criticism for allegedly impeding the dynamic individualism of American capitalism. Government withdrew from social protection and provision. De-regulation and privatization swept across the domestic policy landscape. As a result, inequality increased.  And the well-being of American households was yoked ever more tightly to increasingly unregulated financial markets. These ideas, policies, and outcomes -- often labeled \u201cneoliberalism\u201d by scholars -- account, in part, for both the insurgency of Bernie Sanders and the shocking victory of Donald Trump. \n\nThe past offers tools for understanding our present circumstances.

In addition to my affiliation with the History Department, I teach in the Creative Publishing and Critical Journalism M.A. at The New School for Social Research and am Executive Editor of Public Seminar. My main research and teaching areas are in United States history after 1970, political history, the histories of gender and sexuality, mass culture, media and Internet Studies. My interest in how media has shaped political culture began with my first book, War on Crime: Bandits, G-men, and the Politics of Mass Culture (Rutgers University Press, 1998.) War on Crime was the first book to show that the FBI\u2019s militarization of popular culture in the 1930s helped to create the strong New Deal state in the public mind. Subsequently, the writing I did for an edited collection with historian Renee Romano, Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back (University of Georgia Press, 2012) brought many of the questions I had asked in War on Crime into my study of a more recent political past found in multimedia archives far more fragile and evanescent than those of the 1930s: television, digital environments, email and social media. My current research focus is on the methodologies that make digital archive useful; and on the history of putting Presidential campaigns on the Internet. My life as a historian began as an undergraduate working in the archives of Yale University. An English major in a department that prized close reading, I was poised for the innovative use of critical theory, cultural studies, gender and queer studies as these fields became important to historical study in my graduate years. A historian with an interdisciplinarian heart, I had the good fortune to write my dissertation under the direction of political historian Susan Ware and to be a member of historical sociologist Charles Tilly\u2019s Proseminar on the State in the early years of the Committee on Historical Studies at The New School. My next major research project, Beyond Pornography: Susan Brownmiller, Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon and the Fight to End Violence Against Women, 1968-2000, caused me to dig deeply into a political world that saw media as a political problem in and of itself: second wave radical feminism. In this project, I have conducted oral histories, dug deeply into multiple archives, watched movies and television, and plunged into the debates that tore a vital social movement apart during the feminist sex wars of the 1980s. During this project, Renee Romano and I became aware how little guidance there was for historians as they tackled the archival, ethical and practical problems of writing the recent past. Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back was the result of these conversations, and is still used in graduate courses today. In 2006, I became a media participant, launching my blog Tenured Radical on a free Blogspot platform (it is now my Twitter handle). In 2011, I was invited to move to The Chronicle of Higher Education, where I wrote until I closed down the blog in 2015. During this period I made the transition to what is often called public scholarship, writing for a general audience at publications that include Dissent, The Village Voice, Inside Higher Education, berfrois, review31, and Jacobin. Currently I am the Executive Editor of Public Seminar, a web publication at The New School for Social Research where scholars write the first draft of history for a general audience. I am also the Director of the Digital Humanities Initiative, which (among other projects) hosts OutHIstory.org, a digital history platform devoted to supporting research on the LGBTQ past. My teaching reflects my scholarly commitments: to well-researched, accessibly written history; to scholarship that matters beyond the academy; to feminist and queer activist research; and to helping young historians acquire the methodological and technical tools they need to research and write the past in a twenty-first century digital world.

My main research and teaching areas are post-1945 US history, the global 1960s, the Holocaust, social movements, political violence, and human rights in the \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d\n\nMy first book is Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies (2004). It is a pioneering work of global history that engages the parallel trajectories of \u201carmed struggle\u201d groups in the United States and West Germany. My second book is The New Life: The Jewish Students of Postwar Germany (2014). It examines the efforts of Holocaust survivors, when refugees in postwar Germany, to pursue advanced degrees in German universities. The book is a unique look into the fractious, postwar world and the means by which survivors gained again a sense of power, purpose, and a positive vision of the future.\n\nMy journey into academia began at Cornell University, where I earned a PhD in history under the direction of Dominick LaCapra \u2014 a towering figure across the humanities. Trained in great varieties of critical theory, I brought these to bear in my examination of left-wing radicalism. My key concerns were the political, ethical and existential appeal of violence; how past collective traumas shaped political behavior; and the need for normative limits to constrain the actions of the state and dissidents alike.\n\nWhile doing research for the project, I developed my passion for oral history. Interviewing historical subjects is an unsurpassable way to engage the intimacy of lived experience. I have conducted close to 100 oral histories, and I relish teaching oral history to my students.\n\nWorking on my first book, I ran across many other young scholars fascinated by the 1960s. To give our work a platform of its own, I co-founded in 2008 the interdisciplinary publication The Sixties: A Journal of History, Politics, and Culture. I continue to co-edit the journal, which publishes exciting work on the global 1960s.\n\nMy work on the postwar experience of Holocaust survivors is a bracing inquiry into processes of dehumanization and an account of the process \u2014 often neglected in Holocaust studies \u2014 by which survivors can both reclaim the past and claim new lives. For it I did oral histories in the United States, Germany, and Israel.\n\nI remain very active in international communities studying the global 1960s. I also remain fascinated by the origins, evolution, and success and failure of social movements. I recently co-edited a book on opposition to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the 1980s. My current book project is a study of domestic opposition to America\u2019s post-9-11 wars. For it I am conducting oral histories, scouring the archives on anti-war organizations, and reflecting on my own opposition to the wars.\n\nMy scholarship reflects my activism, and vice versa. I am a longstanding veteran of social justice struggles. Starting in the 1980s, these include: divestment from apartheid South Africa; opposition to CIA campus recruitment; HIV/AIDs activism; the movement for global economic justice; and opposition to the 1991 and 2003 Iraq wars.

I approach this broad interest in a non-traditional way. Most American political science focuses inquiry on institutions, choice, and decision-making. By contrast, I focus my attention on the ways that public meanings define the problems that the polity understands itself to share as well as the range of choices that citizens perceive to be before them. Questions that focus on the way that public meanings shape our politics require a careful engagement with public discourse, like that found in newspapers, shared through social networks online, or spoken in the meeting houses of civic and social movement organizations. These discourses provide an empirical record of what members of the polity acknowledge as politically valuable as well as clues to the logics that people commonly use to associate their beliefs and values with the problems that they recognize in the world as they find it, imbricated as it is with all the structural, institutional, group-based and affective elements of life and politics. This observation of the central practical importance of discourse to democratic politics as we actually experience it as members of the polity, leads me to utilize methodologies, both theoretical and empirical, that reveal political discourse as a practical source of information, including statistical examinations of discursive content and theoretical analyses of the meanings unearthed therein.", "purpose_summary_statements": "", "research_interests": "", "role": "Assistant Professor of Politics  ", "school": "", "school_college": "", "semester": "", "sheet": "People", "speakers": "", "sponsors": "", "sponsors_schools": "", "staff_structure": "", "students": "", "subject": "", "team_structure": "", "themes": "", "topics": "", "university_affiliation": "", "websites": "", "where": "", "path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/1.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "0", "tag2": "1", "tag3": "1", "tag4": "0", "tag5": "0", "tag6": "0"}, {"CRN": "", "center_lab_name": "", "centers": "", "collaboration": "", "concentration": "U.S. politics: American political development: national political institutions, political and social movements; American political thought; citizenship, immigration, and ethnicity.

As well as complementary ideologies (most notably, sexism), there is also the flipside of misogyny which deserves to be considered: the exonerating narratives and excessive sympathy of which comparatively privileged men tend to be the beneficiaries. I call the latter \u2018himpathy.\u2019 \n\nThis talk departs from the main example of himpathy I discuss in my recent book, Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny: that of Brock Turner, the convicted sexual assailant and then student at Stanford University. (Turner\u2019s trial became notorious when he received disproportionate and inappropriate sympathy over his female victim from multiple sources, including the judge who found him guilty.) But, as I will argue, this turns out to be only one variety of himpathy among many. Himpathy comprises a family of emotional biases that distort our moral thought and attention in ways that not only serve to obscure, but may even plausibly cause, damaging forms of misogyny\u2014e.g., the hostility girls and women face when they try to testify against or seek justice vis-\u00e0-vis an antecedent recipient of himpathy for his misogynistic behavior, sexual violence, and so on.

Economists and policymakers have generally considered greater labor force participation as the primary channel through which such empowerment can be achieved. But is more work necessarily the answer? Considering that poor women from the South have always worked excessively long hours, that the nature of work itself is often degrading, exploitative and poorly paid, and that most women work a double day, is this emphasis on work as empowerment misplaced? Given the rapid rise of robotic and AI technologies that threaten future job creation particularly in exports, can we imagine alternative paths to economic empowerment that recognize women's 'invisible' labor? What role do a Universal Basic Income and other social protection schemes play in this regard? Is it possible to reimagine work as an aesthetic and creative category rather than simply a category of capitalist production? How can feminist economics contribute to this discussion?

The event will explore issues of race and the environment in the 21st century, featuring a discussion with our faculty as they explore the themes of the Principles and opportunities for achieving environmental justice across different social movements, practices, and disciplinary perspectives\n\nDelegates to the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit held on October 24-27 in 1991 in Washington D.C., drafted and adopted the 17 Principles. These Principles were created to build a national and international movement to fight the destruction and seizing of lands and communities and to secure political, economic, and cultural liberation denied for over 500 years of colonization and oppression. Since then, The Principles have served as a defining document for the grassroots movement for environmental justice.", "event_name": "RACE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY", "event_type": "", "external_board": "", "external_center_name": "", "faculty": "", "first": "", "focus": "", "funding_model": "", "hashtags": "", "instructor": "", "last": "", "lead": "", "leadership_composition": "", "level": "", "link": "", "location": "", "meeting_space": "", "mission": "", "notes": "", "office_location": "", "operational_structure_activities": "", "organization_name": "", "partners": "", "partners_networks": "", "profile": "", "purpose_summary_statements": "", "research_interests": "", "role": "", "school": "", "school_college": "", "semester": "", "sheet": "Events", "speakers": "Maya Wiley\nMia White\nMindy Fullilove\nAna Baptista\nMichelle DePass", "sponsors": "", "sponsors_schools": "", "staff_structure": "", "students": "", "subject": "", "team_structure": "", "themes": "", "topics": "", "university_affiliation": "", "websites": "", "where": "at Tishman Auditorium, 63 Fifth Avenu", "path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/2.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "1", "tag2": "1", "tag3": "1", "tag4": "1", "tag5": "0", "tag6": "0"}, {"CRN": "", "center_lab_name": "", "centers": "", "collaboration": "", "concentration": "", "contact": "", "course_name": "", "current_courses": "", "days_times": "", "department_affiliation": "", "description": "", "differentiators": "", "est": "", "event_date": "October 2, 2017 at 6:00PM", "event_description": "", "event_name": "RACE IN THE UNITED STATES: THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES - UPRISING, RECLAMATION, INNOVATION   ", "event_type": "", "external_board": "", "external_center_name": "", "faculty": "", "first": "", "focus": "", "funding_model": "", "hashtags": "", "instructor": "", "last": "", "lead": "", "leadership_composition": "", "level": "", "link": "", "location": "", "meeting_space": "", "mission": "", "notes": "", "office_location": "", "operational_structure_activities": "", "organization_name": "", "partners": "", "partners_networks": "", "profile": "", "purpose_summary_statements": "", "research_interests": "", "role": "", "school": "", "school_college": "", "semester": "", "sheet": "Events", "speakers": "", "sponsors": "", "sponsors_schools": "", "staff_structure": "", "students": "", "subject": "", "team_structure": "", "themes": "", "topics": "", "university_affiliation": "", "websites": "", "where": "University Center\n63 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY", "path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/2.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "1", "tag2": "0", "tag3": "0", "tag4": "0", "tag5": "0", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "Social Movements", "center_lab_name": "", "centers": "", "collaboration": "", "concentration": "", "contact": "", "course_name": "Political Sensorium", "current_courses": "", "days_times": "Wed.  3:50 - 6:30 PM ", "department_affiliation": "", "description": "", "differentiators": "", "est": "", "event_date": "", "event_description": "", "event_name": "", "event_type": "", "external_board": "", "external_center_name": "", "faculty": "", "first": "", "focus": "", "funding_model": "", "hashtags": "", "instructor": "Ann Snitow and Victoria Hattam ", "last": "", "lead": "", "leadership_composition": "", "level": "Undergraduate", "link": "", "location": "", "meeting_space": "", "mission": "", "notes": "", "office_location": "", "operational_structure_activities": "", "organization_name": "", "partners": "", "partners_networks": "", "profile": "", "purpose_summary_statements": "", "research_interests": "", "role": "", "school": "", "school_college": "", "semester": "Spring 2018", "sheet": "Courses", "speakers": "", "sponsors": "", "sponsors_schools": "", "staff_structure": "", "students": "", "subject": "", "team_structure": "", "themes": "", "topics": "", "university_affiliation": "", "websites": "", "where": "", "path": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3milychu/csmi-data/master/assets/3.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "0", "tag2": "1", "tag3": "1", "tag4": "0", "tag5": "1", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "Social Innovation and Design ", "center_lab_name": "", "centers": "", "collaboration": "", "concentration": "", "contact": "", "course_name": "Breaking Barriers: Social Ventures and Food Access", "current_courses": "", "days_times": "", "department_affiliation": "", "description": "In this course, students will have the opportunity to develop social entrepreneurial ventures to give low-income communities access to affordable, locally grown food.

Situations are different in northern and southern cities but studying both cases will increase the global understanding of political, social, economical, technical and environmental aspects, and widen the range of the possible solutions to be implemented. In all, governance pays a key role. What is the current state of implementation of the Millennium Development Goals with respect to access to water and sanitation services? What is at stake in the privatization debate? What can we expect from technical innovations (desalination, water reuse, conservation...)?

We will examine the creation of the borders of countries, but also the borders between the local and the global, the legal and illegal, the licit and the illicit, self and other. These borders have intertwined histories, structures, and logic that we shall explore together. In particular we will seek to understand order as a dynamic relationship between territory, identity and belonging, and justice as a question of responsibility and ethics at the collective and personal level in an intimate relationship to forms of order. In other words, how did we get to where we are today, and what should-and can-we do about it?

Policymakers, journalists, and others rely on the Center\u2019s credible and well-informed work \u2013 work that not only makes headlines, but also makes a difference.\n\nIdeas \nWe identify practical solutions and fresh ideas to address pressing social and economic issues. Urban Matters is our newest, weekly outlet for ideas and insights from leading thinkers and practitioners.

Our goal is to advance the practice and discourse of design-led social innovation to foster more equitable and sustainable cities and practices. In a complex world facing numerous systemic challenges, DESIS Lab members rethink assumptions about cultural and economic environments, bringing nuanced approaches drawn from integrated design practices to communities of all kinds. In the DESIS Lab, service design is considered an advanced approach, one integrating many design disciplines.\n\nFoundations\nThree foundations guide our research in design strategies:\n\nBridging structural holes: Social settings often suffer from severe information asymmetries. We seek to bridge information gaps and find ways of sharing needed information more effectively.\nValuing tacit knowledge: People in a social system rely on both explicit forms of knowledge and \u201ctacit knowledge\u201d\u2014information individuals and communities develop and share through habits and customs. The use of participatory design methods reveals and codifies this subjective knowledge.\nNurturing heterarchies: Whereas researchers have focused on social hierarchies and structural asymmetries, little attention has been paid to heterarchies\u2014the lateral forms of collaboration through which social life is constructed. We promote such interdependent networks as it generates more opportunities for heterogeneous forms of collaboration.\nLocal and Global\nThe lab works with local partners in New York City and with global partners through the DESIS Network, participating in large-scale research programs and projects to effect social change. The DESIS Network consists of more than 30 design labs based in universities around the world that orient their teaching and research activities towards social innovation and sustainability.
