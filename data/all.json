My intellectual interests and professional activities are wide ranging and cross a number of academic disciplines.  My research and teaching areas are women\u2019s and gender history,  American cultural and social history, and the history of cities.  My first book,  When Ladies Go A-Thieving: Middle-Class Shoplifters in the Victorian Department Store, is a study of late nineteenthen century consumer culture, respectable thieves (aka  'Kleptomaniacs'), and the medical establishment.  The book has been cited as a provocative, compelling, original, and strongly feminist work.\n\nMy current book project, The Woman with Worn-Out Shoes: Gender: Homelessness, and the Great Depression, still focuses on women and cities but is a study of newly- poor homeless women and their encounter with gender stereotypes, social norms, and public policy during the catastrophic economic crisis of the 1930s.  Unlike the homeless crisis of the 1970s and '80s, these women were rarely seen on city streets nor were they standing in the ubiquitous breadlines of the period. Without  families, steady jobs or  \"a bed of their own\"  they were among the most desperate of the urban population, but, in a decade of unimaginable scarcity,  were so far down in the ranks of those deemed truly needy they remained virtually invisible.  \n", "purpose_summary_statements": "0", "research_interests": "Research Interests:\nGender, cities, social movements, public pollicy, social and cultural history\n", "role": "Associate Professor of History", "school": "0", "school_college": "0", "semester": "0", "sheet": "1", "speakers": "0", "sponsors": "0", "sponsors_schools": "0", "staff_structure": "0", "students": "0", "subject": "0", "themes": "0", "topics": "0", "websites": "0", "where": "0", "path": "1.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "1", "tag2": "0", "tag3": "0", "tag4": "1", "tag5": "1", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "0", "center_lab_name": "0", "centers": "0", "collaboration": "0", "concentration": "0", "contact": "agids@newschool.edu", "course_name": "0", "current_courses": "Print & Prison Indust Complex\nCollab: Human Services\nWorldmaking", "days_times": "0", "department_affiliation": "0", "description": "0", "event_date": "0", "event_description": "0", "event_name": "0", "event_type": "0", "faculty": "0", "first": "Shana", "hashtags": "0", "instructor": "0", "last": "Agid", "level": "0", "location": "0", "meeting_space": "0", "notes": "0", "office_location": "0", "organization_name": "0", "partners": "0", "profile": "Shana Agid is an artist, teacher, writer, and activist whose work focuses on relationships of power and difference, particularly regarding sexuality, race, and gender in visual and political cultures.

She works directly with impacted communities and coalitions to advance environmental justice policies,  zero waste systems, climate justice and resiliency plans, cumulative impacts tools, and mitigation strategies tied to goods movement industries. Her current research focuses on the use of municipal and state land use and zoning tools to support environmental justice goals and address cumulative environmental impacts in disproportionately impacted communities. Ana helped to develop and implement a model Environmental Justice and Cumulative Impacts Ordinance in Newark, New Jersey. She also focuses on issues related to climate justice policies at the national and state level. She is currently leading research at TEDC in collaboration with the Center for Earth, Energy & Democracy and the Urban Environment Institute at Thomas Edison State College focused on the equity implications of states climate mitigation policies. Her recent publication examines the environmental justice implications of the promotion of waste incineration and other biomass technologies in national climate mitigation strategies. Ana's research extends to issues related to environmental and health impacts of the global goods movement in seaport cities; zero waste and anti-incineration policies that can help cities transform their relationship to waste; just transition and community based resilience planning efforts; urban air pollution mitigation policies and community science air monitoring protocols; community engaged scholarship and participatory action research methods. Her doctoral dissertation focused on the implementation of state environmental justice policies across the United States, which institutionalized the environmental justice discourse absent systemic approaches to the distributive and structural roots of injustice.\n\nPrior to joining The New School, Ana served as the Director of Environmental Justice and Community Development programs for the Ironbound Community Corporation (ICC) in her hometown of Newark, New Jersey. At ICC she oversaw a wide range of environmental justice, community development, planning and research projects aimed at implementing grassroots strategies for environmental justice. This work included: the creation of Newark's Riverfront Park, a five year community revitalization project in East Ferry Street Neighborhood, Superfund and Brownfields clean ups, community based science and monitoring initiatives, establishment of urban farming programs, environmental justice leadership training, community based climate resiliency and adapatation planning, and litigation against the state's largest garbage incinerator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for  mitigation of diesel pollution, and a natural gas power plant.  \n\nAna completed her Ph.D. in Urban Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.

It explores both the political economy of the Egyptian state and the role of political-economic thought in the struggle over British rule following the occupation of 1882. For decades now, Egypt has long appeared as a classic case of peripheral development. From this perspective, British rule simply reinforced Egypt\u2019s prior status as a producer of raw cotton and a market for manufactured goods from Europe. All but obscured in this version of things is Egypt\u2019s emergence as a key site for investment and experimentation in the worldwide financial expansion that characterized global capitalism at the close of the nineteenth century. State of the Field tells for the first time the story of that financial boom and the protracted crisis that followed. And it argues that this long-neglected process of financialization was of central importance to the politics of British rule. Across the three decades of Britain\u2019s \u201cveiled protectorate,\u201d State of the Field traces the complex career of the discourse I label \u201ccolonial economism.\u201d From the outset, British officials held that Egyptians, as political subjects, were capable of no more and no less than a recognition of their own bare material interests; the legitimacy of foreign rule would accordingly vary as a direct function of the \u201ceconomic development\u201d that British reform could deliver. In grappling with a discourse of colonial improvement that appeared to be succeeding on its own terms, Egypt\u2019s early nationalist thinkers elaborated their own alternative accounts of the ephemeral and uneven qualities of financialization. They thereby articulated a range of rigorous, if fragmentary, critiques of the political-economic theories upon which Britain\u2019s reforms had rested. In time, their efforts to find grounds for national sovereignty beyond the mere calculus of economic gain and loss influenced popular interpretations of such basic categories as crisis, progress, and independence.\n\nAlongside this current project, I have begun work on a collaboration with my colleague Hussein Omar at the University of Oxford. Tentatively entitled The Fanatical Radical: the Life and Thought of \u2018Abd al-Aziz Jawish, the project reexamines the long career of one of the most important and creative political thinkers of the early twentieth century. When mentioned at all in existing histories, the itinerant North African journalist, educator, organizer, and strategist appears as a figure of almost singular ignominy: a \u201cviolent orator,\u201d an \u201cextremist leader,\u201d and a \u201creligious fanatic.\u201d Rather than a faithful assessment of his ideas, we argue that these labels indexed the challenge that Jawish\u2019s idiosyncratic brand of scholar activism posed to the imperial order of his day. Like many of Egypt\u2019s leading intellectuals at the time, Jawish was a student of Muhammad \u2018Abduh, and we read his life\u2019s work as a road not taken by modern Islamic thought, one that briefly transformed the horizons of political possibility across much of the Islamic world only to be eclipsed by the influence of \u2018Abduh\u2019s more famous disciple Rashid Rida. Finally, I have begun working on a longer-term project entitled Renting the Waters: the Suez Canal and the Production of Global Natures. It will examine the long and complex history of the Suez Canal as a vantage from which to consider the changing role of rents in the history of global capitalism.

Over the course of the last forty years, the collective solutions that once nurtured the American middle class \u2013 including labor unions along with government and corporate-sponsored social provisions \u2013 drew increasing criticism for allegedly impeding the dynamic individualism of American capitalism. Government withdrew from social protection and provision. De-regulation and privatization swept across the domestic policy landscape. As a result, inequality increased.  And the well-being of American households was yoked ever more tightly to increasingly unregulated financial markets. These ideas, policies, and outcomes -- often labeled \u201cneoliberalism\u201d by scholars -- account, in part, for both the insurgency of Bernie Sanders and the shocking victory of Donald Trump. \n\nThe past offers tools for understanding our present circumstances.

In addition to my affiliation with the History Department, I teach in the Creative Publishing and Critical Journalism M.A. at The New School for Social Research and am Executive Editor of Public Seminar. My main research and teaching areas are in United States history after 1970, political history, the histories of gender and sexuality, mass culture, media and Internet Studies. My interest in how media has shaped political culture began with my first book, War on Crime: Bandits, G-men, and the Politics of Mass Culture (Rutgers University Press, 1998.) War on Crime was the first book to show that the FBI\u2019s militarization of popular culture in the 1930s helped to create the strong New Deal state in the public mind. Subsequently, the writing I did for an edited collection with historian Renee Romano, Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back (University of Georgia Press, 2012) brought many of the questions I had asked in War on Crime into my study of a more recent political past found in multimedia archives far more fragile and evanescent than those of the 1930s: television, digital environments, email and social media. My current research focus is on the methodologies that make digital archive useful; and on the history of putting Presidential campaigns on the Internet. My life as a historian began as an undergraduate working in the archives of Yale University. An English major in a department that prized close reading, I was poised for the innovative use of critical theory, cultural studies, gender and queer studies as these fields became important to historical study in my graduate years. A historian with an interdisciplinarian heart, I had the good fortune to write my dissertation under the direction of political historian Susan Ware and to be a member of historical sociologist Charles Tilly\u2019s Proseminar on the State in the early years of the Committee on Historical Studies at The New School. My next major research project, Beyond Pornography: Susan Brownmiller, Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon and the Fight to End Violence Against Women, 1968-2000, caused me to dig deeply into a political world that saw media as a political problem in and of itself: second wave radical feminism. In this project, I have conducted oral histories, dug deeply into multiple archives, watched movies and television, and plunged into the debates that tore a vital social movement apart during the feminist sex wars of the 1980s. During this project, Renee Romano and I became aware how little guidance there was for historians as they tackled the archival, ethical and practical problems of writing the recent past. Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History That Talks Back was the result of these conversations, and is still used in graduate courses today. In 2006, I became a media participant, launching my blog Tenured Radical on a free Blogspot platform (it is now my Twitter handle). In 2011, I was invited to move to The Chronicle of Higher Education, where I wrote until I closed down the blog in 2015. During this period I made the transition to what is often called public scholarship, writing for a general audience at publications that include Dissent, The Village Voice, Inside Higher Education, berfrois, review31, and Jacobin. Currently I am the Executive Editor of Public Seminar, a web publication at The New School for Social Research where scholars write the first draft of history for a general audience. I am also the Director of the Digital Humanities Initiative, which (among other projects) hosts OutHIstory.org, a digital history platform devoted to supporting research on the LGBTQ past. My teaching reflects my scholarly commitments: to well-researched, accessibly written history; to scholarship that matters beyond the academy; to feminist and queer activist research; and to helping young historians acquire the methodological and technical tools they need to research and write the past in a twenty-first century digital world.

My main research and teaching areas are post-1945 US history, the global 1960s, the Holocaust, social movements, political violence, and human rights in the \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d\n\nMy first book is Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies (2004). It is a pioneering work of global history that engages the parallel trajectories of \u201carmed struggle\u201d groups in the United States and West Germany. My second book is The New Life: The Jewish Students of Postwar Germany (2014). It examines the efforts of Holocaust survivors, when refugees in postwar Germany, to pursue advanced degrees in German universities. The book is a unique look into the fractious, postwar world and the means by which survivors gained again a sense of power, purpose, and a positive vision of the future.\n\nMy journey into academia began at Cornell University, where I earned a PhD in history under the direction of Dominick LaCapra \u2014 a towering figure across the humanities. Trained in great varieties of critical theory, I brought these to bear in my examination of left-wing radicalism. My key concerns were the political, ethical and existential appeal of violence; how past collective traumas shaped political behavior; and the need for normative limits to constrain the actions of the state and dissidents alike.\n\nWhile doing research for the project, I developed my passion for oral history. Interviewing historical subjects is an unsurpassable way to engage the intimacy of lived experience. I have conducted close to 100 oral histories, and I relish teaching oral history to my students.\n\nWorking on my first book, I ran across many other young scholars fascinated by the 1960s. To give our work a platform of its own, I co-founded in 2008 the interdisciplinary publication The Sixties: A Journal of History, Politics, and Culture. I continue to co-edit the journal, which publishes exciting work on the global 1960s.\n\nMy work on the postwar experience of Holocaust survivors is a bracing inquiry into processes of dehumanization and an account of the process \u2014 often neglected in Holocaust studies \u2014 by which survivors can both reclaim the past and claim new lives. For it I did oral histories in the United States, Germany, and Israel.\n\nI remain very active in international communities studying the global 1960s. I also remain fascinated by the origins, evolution, and success and failure of social movements. I recently co-edited a book on opposition to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the 1980s. My current book project is a study of domestic opposition to America\u2019s post-9-11 wars. For it I am conducting oral histories, scouring the archives on anti-war organizations, and reflecting on my own opposition to the wars.\n\nMy scholarship reflects my activism, and vice versa. I am a longstanding veteran of social justice struggles. Starting in the 1980s, these include: divestment from apartheid South Africa; opposition to CIA campus recruitment; HIV/AIDs activism; the movement for global economic justice; and opposition to the 1991 and 2003 Iraq wars. Since 2005, I have been a leading member of Witness Against Torture \u2013 a grassroots, direction action group seeking to close Guantanamo prison and end US torture. My work with the group is a subject of an oral history conducted by Columbia University for its \u201cGuantanamo Bay Oral History Project.\u201d\n\nBeyond my academic work, I have written essays for Public Seminar, The Los Angeles Review of Books, and Waging Nonviolence. They range from reflections on the violence of the New Left; to the fate of \u201cwar on terror\u201d prisoners; to the engagement of torture by the arts world; to the treatment of the 1960s in pop culture such as the TV show Mad Men; to the life and legacy of iconic American radicals.\n\nThe New School is a perfect home for me, in its combination of critical inquiry, political engagement, and the idealism of the young and old alike.\n\n", "purpose_summary_statements": "0", "research_interests": "0", "role": "Professor of History", "school": "0", "school_college": "0", "semester": "0", "sheet": "1", "speakers": "0", "sponsors": "0", "sponsors_schools": "0", "staff_structure": "0", "students": "0", "subject": "0", "themes": "0", "topics": "0", "websites": "0", "where": "0", "path": "1.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "0", "tag2": "0", "tag3": "1", "tag4": "0", "tag5": "1", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "0", "center_lab_name": "0", "centers": "0", "collaboration": "0", "concentration": "0", "contact": "miawhite@newschool.edu", "course_name": "0", "current_courses": "Independent Study (Open Campus)\nEnv Hist, Race & Resource Mgmt\nBlack Geographies\nDirected Research", "days_times": "0", "department_affiliation": "0", "description": "0", "event_date": "0", "event_description": "0", "event_name": "0", "event_type": "0", "faculty": "0", "first": "Mia", "hashtags": "0", "instructor": "0", "last": "White", "level": "0", "location": "0", "meeting_space": "0", "notes": "0", "office_location": "0", "organization_name": "0", "partners": "0", "profile": "Dr. White is an expert in the intersection of black studies, environmental studies, critical urban studies, political ecology, social movements, and community development.

I approach this broad interest in a non-traditional way. Most American political science focuses inquiry on institutions, choice, and decision-making. By contrast, I focus my attention on the ways that public meanings define the problems that the polity understands itself to share as well as the range of choices that citizens perceive to be before them. Questions that focus on the way that public meanings shape our politics require a careful engagement with public discourse, like that found in newspapers, shared through social networks online, or spoken in the meeting houses of civic and social movement organizations. These discourses provide an empirical record of what members of the polity acknowledge as politically valuable as well as clues to the logics that people commonly use to associate their beliefs and values with the problems that they recognize in the world as they find it, imbricated as it is with all the structural, institutional, group-based and affective elements of life and politics. This observation of the central practical importance of discourse to democratic politics as we actually experience it as members of the polity, leads me to utilize methodologies, both theoretical and empirical, that reveal political discourse as a practical source of information, including statistical examinations of discursive content and theoretical analyses of the meanings unearthed therein.", "purpose_summary_statements": "0", "research_interests": "0", "role": "Assistant Professor of Politics  ", "school": "0", "school_college": "0", "semester": "0", "sheet": "1", "speakers": "0", "sponsors": "0", "sponsors_schools": "0", "staff_structure": "0", "students": "0", "subject": "0", "themes": "0", "topics": "0", "websites": "0", "where": "0", "path": "1.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "0", "tag2": "0", "tag3": "0", "tag4": "0", "tag5": "1", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "0", "center_lab_name": "0", "centers": "0", "collaboration": "0", "concentration": "U.S. politics: American political development: national political institutions, political and social movements; American political thought; citizenship, immigration, and ethnicity.

As well as complementary ideologies (most notably, sexism), there is also the flipside of misogyny which deserves to be considered: the exonerating narratives and excessive sympathy of which comparatively privileged men tend to be the beneficiaries. I call the latter \u2018himpathy.\u2019 \n\nThis talk departs from the main example of himpathy I discuss in my recent book, Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny: that of Brock Turner, the convicted sexual assailant and then student at Stanford University. (Turner\u2019s trial became notorious when he received disproportionate and inappropriate sympathy over his female victim from multiple sources, including the judge who found him guilty.) But, as I will argue, this turns out to be only one variety of himpathy among many. Himpathy comprises a family of emotional biases that distort our moral thought and attention in ways that not only serve to obscure, but may even plausibly cause, damaging forms of misogyny\u2014e.g., the hostility girls and women face when they try to testify against or seek justice vis-\u00e0-vis an antecedent recipient of himpathy for his misogynistic behavior, sexual violence, and so on. The talk will close by exploring some implications of this claim about moral/social psychology for the future of the #MeToo movement.\n\n", "event_name": "Spring MaP Colloquium: \"More than Fair: How Excessive Sympathy for Him (\u201cHimpathy\u201d) Obscures and Causes Misogyny\"", "event_type": "0", "faculty": "0", "first": "0", "hashtags": "0", "instructor": "0", "last": "0", "level": "0", "location": "0", "meeting_space": "0", "notes": "0", "office_location": "0", "organization_name": "0", "partners": "0", "profile": "0", "purpose_summary_statements": "0", "research_interests": "0", "role": "0", "school": "0", "school_college": "0", "semester": "0", "sheet": "2", "speakers": "Speaker: Dr. Kate Manne (Philosophy Department,Cornell University)", "sponsors": "0", "sponsors_schools": "The New School for Social Research", "staff_structure": "0", "students": "0", "subject": "0", "themes": "Humanity, Society, Social Justice", "topics": "0", "websites": "0", "where": "Wolff Conference Room, Room D1103, Albert and Vera List Academic Center\n6 East 16th Street, New York, NY 10003, Room D1103", "path": "2.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "0", "tag2": "1", "tag3": "0", "tag4": "1", "tag5": "1", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "0", "center_lab_name": "0", "centers": "0", "collaboration": "0", "concentration": "0", "contact": "0", "course_name": "0", "current_courses": "0", "days_times": "0", "department_affiliation": "0", "description": "0", "event_date": "THURSDAY, MARCH 1, 2018 AT 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM\n", "event_description": "Book Launch: #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond\nPlease join us for the launch of #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond (Public Seminar Books, 2018), a collection of essays from scholars and activists about the \n\"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, VA, in August 2017\n\n#Charlottesville: Before and Beyond, a project of Public Seminar Books, is the first book to emerge from, and critically respond to, the violence that took place in Charlottesville, VA, in August 2017, when white nationalists descended on the city to protest the removal of a Confederate monument in a public park near the University of Virginia. \n\nThe violence that ensued \u2014  four casualties, including the murder of counter-protester Heather Heyer \u2014 left the country bewildered, angry, and frightened about ascendant racism.\n\nThe essays in #Charlottesville: Before and Beyond attempt to answer questions that still plague us after the violence of August 2017.

Economists and policymakers have generally considered greater labor force participation as the primary channel through which such empowerment can be achieved. But is more work necessarily the answer? Considering that poor women from the South have always worked excessively long hours, that the nature of work itself is often degrading, exploitative and poorly paid, and that most women work a double day, is this emphasis on work as empowerment misplaced? Given the rapid rise of robotic and AI technologies that threaten future job creation particularly in exports, can we imagine alternative paths to economic empowerment that recognize women's 'invisible' labor? What role do a Universal Basic Income and other social protection schemes play in this regard? Is it possible to reimagine work as an aesthetic and creative category rather than simply a category of capitalist production? How can feminist economics contribute to this discussion?

Since then, The Principles have served as a defining document for the grassroots movement for environmental justice.", "event_name": "RACE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY", "event_type": "0", "faculty": "0", "first": "0", "hashtags": "0", "instructor": "0", "last": "0", "level": "0", "location": "0", "meeting_space": "0", "notes": "0", "office_location": "0", "organization_name": "0", "partners": "0", "profile": "0", "purpose_summary_statements": "0", "research_interests": "0", "role": "0", "school": "0", "school_college": "0", "semester": "0", "sheet": "2", "speakers": "Maya Wiley\nMia White\nMindy Fullilove\nAna Baptista\nMichelle DePass", "sponsors": "0", "sponsors_schools": "0", "staff_structure": "0", "students": "0", "subject": "0", "themes": "0", "topics": "0", "websites": "0", "where": "at Tishman Auditorium, 63 Fifth Avenu", "path": "2.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "1", "tag2": "1", "tag3": "1", "tag4": "0", "tag5": "1", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "0", "center_lab_name": "0", "centers": "0", "collaboration": "0", "concentration": "0", "contact": "0", "course_name": "0", "current_courses": "0", "days_times": "0", "department_affiliation": "0", "description": "0", "event_date": "October 2, 2017 at 6:00PM", "event_description": "0", "event_name": "RACE IN THE UNITED STATES: THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES - UPRISING, RECLAMATION, INNOVATION   ", "event_type": "0", "faculty": "0", "first": "0", "hashtags": "0", "instructor": "0", "last": "0", "level": "0", "location": "0", "meeting_space": "0", "notes": "0", "office_location": "0", "organization_name": "0", "partners": "0", "profile": "0", "purpose_summary_statements": "0", "research_interests": "0", "role": "0", "school": "0", "school_college": "0", "semester": "0", "sheet": "2", "speakers": "0", "sponsors": "0", "sponsors_schools": "0", "staff_structure": "0", "students": "0", "subject": "0", "themes": "0", "topics": "0", "websites": "0", "where": "University Center\n63 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY", "path": "2.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "0", "tag2": "0", "tag3": "0", "tag4": "0", "tag5": "0", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "Social Movements", "center_lab_name": "0", "centers": "0", "collaboration": "0", "concentration": "0", "contact": "0", "course_name": "Political Sensorium", "current_courses": "0", "days_times": "Wed.  3:50 - 6:30 PM ", "department_affiliation": "0", "description": "0", "event_date": "0", "event_description": "0", "event_name": "0", "event_type": "0", "faculty": "0", "first": "0", "hashtags": "0", "instructor": "Ann Snitow and Victoria Hattam ", "last": "0", "level": "Undergraduate", "location": "0", "meeting_space": "0", "notes": "0", "office_location": "0", "organization_name": "0", "partners": "0", "profile": "0", "purpose_summary_statements": "0", "research_interests": "0", "role": "0", "school": "0", "school_college": "0", "semester": "Spring 2018", "sheet": "3", "speakers": "0", "sponsors": "0", "sponsors_schools": "0", "staff_structure": "0", "students": "0", "subject": "0", "themes": "0", "topics": "0", "websites": "0", "where": "0", "path": "3.jpg", "size": "40000", "tag1": "1", "tag2": "1", "tag3": "0", "tag4": "1", "tag5": "0", "tag6": "1"}, {"CRN": "Social Innovation and Design ", "center_lab_name": "0", "centers": "0", "collaboration": "0", "concentration": "0", "contact": "0", "course_name": "Breaking Barriers: Social Ventures and Food Access", "current_courses": "0", "days_times": "0", "department_affiliation": "0", "description": "In this course, students will have the opportunity to develop social entrepreneurial ventures to give low-income communities access to affordable, locally grown food.

We will examine the creation of the borders of countries, but also the borders between the local and the global, the legal and illegal, the licit and the illicit, self and other. These borders have intertwined histories, structures, and logic that we shall explore together. In particular we will seek to understand order as a dynamic relationship between territory, identity and belonging, and justice as a question of responsibility and ethics at the collective and personal level in an intimate relationship to forms of order. In other words, how did we get to where we are today, and what should-and can-we do about it?

The last half century has seen unprecedented gains in health - driven by improving living conditions and medical progress - yet the gains have not been even. Stark inequalities mark health outcomes and the \u200bwell being of people around the world. Understanding the \u200bcause\u200b\u200bs \u200bof \u200b health inequities and designing relevant policies and programs demands a consideration of powerful global institutions, actors and rules that extend well outside the health sector. Advocacy for the human right to health increasingly focuses on issues such as the effects of globalization on health\u200b, the effects of trade and investment rules, and the actions of international corporations. Global governance of health thus has to be conceptualized broadly, incorporating multiple global regimes that affect health inequalities or respond to them.

We seek to bridge information gaps and find ways of sharing needed information more effectively.\nValuing tacit knowledge: People in a social system rely on both explicit forms of knowledge and \u201ctacit knowledge\u201d\u2014information individuals and communities develop and share through habits and customs. The use of participatory design methods reveals and codifies this subjective knowledge.\nNurturing heterarchies: Whereas researchers have focused on social hierarchies and structural asymmetries, little attention has been paid to heterarchies\u2014the lateral forms of collaboration through which social life is constructed. We promote such interdependent networks as it generates more opportunities for heterogeneous forms of collaboration.\nLocal and Global\nThe lab works with local partners in New York City and with global partners through the DESIS Network, participating in large-scale research programs and projects to effect social change. The DESIS Network consists of more than 30 design labs based in universities around the world that orient their teaching and research activities towards social innovation and sustainability.
